## Disclaimer

This repository is part of a premedical educational portfolio documenting the development of clinical reasoning skills in critical care, anesthesia, trauma, and perioperative medicine. All cases are hypothetical, de-identified, and simulated for academic training purposes only. This repository does not represent real patients, clinical advice, or professional medical decision-making.

Content is intended exclusively for medical school preparation, demonstrating:

- Supervised shadowing insights and observational learning
- Structured ICU and anesthesia case-based education
- Development of physiologic reasoning and differential diagnosis
- Preparation for medical training environments and clinical clerkships
- Longitudinal engagement with acute care medicine

## ICU Rounds Portfolio: A Progressive Series of Simulated Critical Care Cases

This repository contains a series of structured ICU case reviews modeling real-world critical care thought processes. The goal is to demonstrate maturing clinical reasoning across domains including:

- Hemodynamic instability and shock physiology
- Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Neurocritical care and traumatic brain injury (TBI)
- Perioperative management and post-surgical complications
- Sedation, analgesia, and delirium management
- Fluid resuscitation and acute kidney injury (AKI)
- Trauma and airway emergencies
- ECMO candidacy assessment and advanced life support
- Sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

Each case includes a focused Assessment and Plan, mimicking the structure expected of junior trainees in critical care medicine. Cases progress in complexity, reflecting development from foundational ICU concepts to advanced multi-system management.

This portfolio will continue to expand with additional simulated rounds throughout 2025–2026.

## 1. Purpose of This Portfolio

This portfolio serves as a longitudinal demonstration of clinical reasoning development during premedical training, specifically focused on:

- ICU-level physiology and pathophysiology
- Early critical care decision-making and prioritization
- Anesthesia and perioperative assessment
- Shock classification and management (distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive)
- Ventilator concepts, modes, and weaning strategies
- Sedation strategies and analgesia protocols
- High-stakes triage and resource allocation
- Synthesizing multi-system data into coherent clinical narratives

It will accompany medical school applications as evidence of:

- Self-directed learning and academic initiative
- Sustained interest in anesthesiology and critical care medicine
- Academic maturity and scientific rigor
- Ability to synthesize complex clinical information
- Long-term commitment to acute care medicine and procedural specialties

## 2. Case Series Overview

ICU cases (ranging from moderate complexity to advanced multi-system failure) are reviewed to practice:

- Identifying immediate threats to life (ABCs: airway, breathing, circulation)
- Structuring problem lists by acuity and organ system
- Formulating Assessment and Plan (A/P) sections with evidence-based reasoning
- Refining clinical terminology and documentation standards
- Integrating hemodynamics, ventilation, neurological status, and shock physiology
- Applying critical care literature and guidelines (e.g., Surviving Sepsis Campaign, ARDS Network protocols)
- Developing pattern recognition for common ICU syndromes

**Case Documentation Structure:**
- Each night's cases are documented in a single markdown file (e.g., `night_01_cases.md`)
- Cases are added chronologically as they are completed
- Each file contains multiple cases from that session's rounds
- Progressive complexity is maintained across nights

## 4. Clinical Reasoning Framework

Each case is approached using a systematic framework:

**Initial Assessment (Primary Survey)**
1. Airway patency and protection
2. Breathing adequacy (oxygenation and ventilation)
3. Circulation status (perfusion, shock assessment)
4. Disability (neurological status, GCS)
5. Exposure (comprehensive examination, vital signs review)

**Problem List Development**
- Prioritized by acuity and organ system
- Active vs. chronic issues clearly delineated
- Interdependencies between problems identified

**Differential Diagnosis Generation**
- Evidence-based consideration of likely etiologies
- Critical "cannot miss" diagnoses highlighted
- Diagnostic testing strategies outlined

**Management Priorities**
- Immediate stabilization measures
- Source control and definitive interventions
- Monitoring and reassessment plans
- Anticipation of complications

**Evidence Integration**
- Application of relevant guidelines and trials
- Physiologic reasoning for interventions
- Risk-benefit analysis of treatment options

## 5. Key Learning Themes

Throughout this portfolio, recurrent themes include:

**Hemodynamic Assessment:**
- Interpretation of blood pressure, heart rate, CVP, and urine output
- Shock index calculation and clinical significance
- Fluid responsiveness and passive leg raise testing
- Vasopressor and inotrope selection (norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, dobutamine)

**Respiratory Management:**
- Oxygenation vs. ventilation failure
- Non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP, HFNC) vs. intubation criteria
- Mechanical ventilation modes (volume control, pressure control, PRVC)
- Lung-protective ventilation strategies (low tidal volume, PEEP titration)
- Liberation from mechanical ventilation

**Neurocritical Care:**
- Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scoring
- Intracranial pressure (ICP) management
- Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) optimization
- Sedation interruption and delirium assessment

**Shock Physiology:**
- Distributive (septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic)
- Cardiogenic (myocardial infarction, myocarditis, valvular dysfunction)
- Hypovolemic (hemorrhagic, dehydration)
- Obstructive (pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade)

**Multi-System Integration:**
- Recognizing MODS and organ crosstalk
- Balancing competing physiologic goals (e.g., fluid resuscitation vs. ARDS)
- Anticipating complications and planning ahead
