## Disclaimers

**Institutional Affiliation:**  
This is an independent educational project. It is not an official University of Washington or UW Medicine document and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or approved by UW Medicine, its faculty, or staff.

**Clinical Context:**  
Cases are constructed from published literature, educational resources, and general medical knowledge. Clinical observation at UW Medical Center informed educational learning but does not constitute clinical practice or patient care involvement.

**Educational Purpose:**  
This portfolio demonstrates observational learning, structured case-based reasoning development, and physiologic understanding for medical school preparation. It does not represent independent clinical decision-making or professional medical practice.

**Liability:**  
This work is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Users assume full responsibility for any use of these materials.

**Author Status:**  
Pre-medical student. Not a licensed healthcare professional. Not engaged in clinical practice.

## Portfolio Overview

A comprehensive collection of simulated ICU cases documenting progressive clinical reasoning development in critical care medicine. This portfolio demonstrates systematic approach to:

- Hemodynamic instability and shock physiology
- Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Neurocritical care and traumatic brain injury (TBI)
- Perioperative complications and acute surgical physiology
- Sedation, analgesia, and delirium management
- Fluid resuscitation and acute kidney injury (AKI)
- Trauma and airway emergencies
- ECMO candidacy assessment and advanced life support
- Sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

**Educational Approach:**  
Each case includes structured Assessment and Plan documentation modeled after formats used in critical care training. Cases progress in complexity, reflecting development from foundational ICU concepts to advanced multi-system management.

- Compare with current critical care guidelines

---

## Case Format

Each case follows standardized ICU documentation structure:

**Patient Presentation:**
- Chief complaint and admission diagnosis
- Relevant history and physical exam findings
- Pertinent laboratory and imaging data

**Assessment:**
- Problem list by system
- Physiologic reasoning and differential diagnosis
- Risk stratification and severity assessment

**Plan:**
- System-by-system management approach
- Monitoring and intervention strategy
- Evidence-based rationale for decisions

**Learning Points:**
- Key physiologic concepts
- Clinical pearls and pitfalls
- Relevant literature and guidelines

---

## Evidence Base

Cases are informed by:

- Critical care textbooks (Marino's ICU Book, UpToDate)
- Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines
- American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) recommendations
- Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines
- Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network (ARDSNet) protocols
- Traumatic Brain Injury Foundation guidelines
- Peer-reviewed critical care literature (2020-2025)

Complete references provided in each case directory.
