## ICU Rounds Portfolio: A Progressive Series of Simulated Critical Care Cases

This repository contains a curated series of ICU case reviews modeling real-world critical care thought processes. The goal is to document maturation of clinical reasoning across domains including:

- Hemodynamic instability and shock physiology

## 4. Clinical Reasoning Framework

**Framework Rationale:**

This systematic approach mirrors the structured assessment taught in critical care training programs and ensures comprehensive evaluation of acutely ill patients. The ABCDE primary survey prioritizes immediate life threats while the subsequent problem-oriented approach facilitates organized documentation and decision-making.

### Initial Assessment (Primary Survey)

1. **Airway:** Patency and protection
2. **Breathing:** Adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation
3. **Circulation:** Perfusion status and shock assessment
4. **Disability:** Neurological function (GCS, pupillary response)
5. **Exposure:** Comprehensive examination, vital signs review, lines/drains/tubes assessment

### Problem List Development

- Prioritized by acuity and organ system
- Active issues clearly distinguished from chronic background conditions
- Interdependencies between problems identified
- Physiologic impact of each problem considered

### Differential Diagnosis Generation

- Evidence-based consideration of likely etiologies
- Critical "cannot miss" diagnoses highlighted
- Diagnostic testing strategies outlined
- Likelihood assessment based on clinical presentation

### Management Priorities

- Immediate stabilization measures
- Source control and definitive interventions
- Monitoring and reassessment plans
- Anticipation of complications
- Escalation criteria clearly defined

### Evidence Integration

- Application of relevant clinical practice guidelines
- Reference to landmark critical care trials
- Physiologic reasoning for interventions
- Risk-benefit analysis of treatment options

## 7. Portfolio Development Philosophy

This portfolio reflects a deliberate approach to medical education preparation:

### Progressive Complexity

Cases advance from single-system pathology to multi-organ dysfunction, mirroring the learning curve of clinical training. Early cases focus on fundamental concepts (shock recognition, fluid resuscitation) while later cases integrate multiple simultaneous problems requiring prioritization and systems-based thinking.

### Evidence Integration

Management plans reference current guidelines (Surviving Sepsis Campaign, ARDSNet protocols, TBI guidelines from the Brain Trauma Foundation) demonstrating ability to apply medical literature to clinical scenarios. Key trials are cited where relevant to management decisions.

### Systematic Documentation

Each case follows standardized ICU documentation format, preparing for clinical clerkship expectations. The Assessment & Plan structure mirrors real-world critical care documentation, facilitating transition to clinical environments.

### Physiologic Reasoning

Emphasis on pathophysiology and mechanism-based thinking rather than purely algorithmic approaches. Understanding why interventions work is prioritized over memorization of protocols, building foundation for clinical decision-making.

### Longitudinal Development

Cases documented chronologically to demonstrate reasoning maturation over time. Early cases are preserved without revision to show authentic learning progression. Self-reflection on earlier cases informs continued development.
