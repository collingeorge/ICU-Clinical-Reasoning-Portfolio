## Patient 1 — POD1 CABG ×3 (Early Low Cardiac Output Physiology)

### Summary
58-year-old male, POD1 following CABG ×3, with rising lactate, borderline MAP on norepinephrine, oliguria with venous congestion, and mild right ventricular (RV) dysfunction.

### Assessment
Primary concern is inadequate tissue perfusion despite acceptable arterial pressures, consistent with early low cardiac output syndrome rather than distributive shock.

### Plan
- Maintain MAP ≥65–70 mmHg while prioritizing optimization of cardiac output.
- Continue norepinephrine at current dose.
- Favor inotropic support (dobutamine vs milrinone) over escalation of pure vasoconstrictors if lactate fails to clear.
- Avoid beta-blockade overnight.
- Defer diuresis given venous congestion and borderline forward flow; reassess if hemodynamics stabilize.
- Continue lung-protective ventilation; avoid increases in PEEP due to RV sensitivity.
- Trend lactate, renal function, and urine output.
- Notify attending for rising lactate, escalating vasopressor needs, or worsening AKI.

### Attending-Level Clinical Reasoning (Defense)
**Q:** Why not increase norepinephrine for hypotension?  
**A:** Rising lactate despite acceptable MAP suggests impaired forward flow; increasing afterload alone risks worsening cardiac output.

**Q:** Why defer diuresis despite volume overload?  
**A:** Venous congestion with low forward flow suggests cardiorenal physiology; preload reduction without improved contractility may worsen perfusion.

## Patient 2 — POD2 Acute Type A Aortic Dissection Repair

### Summary
Post-operative day 2 following ascending aorta and hemi-arch repair. Course complicated by intermittent agitation, hypoxemia from atelectasis, and thrombocytopenia.

### Assessment
Primary risk is graft stress or dehiscence from hypertensive surges. Secondary concerns include agitation-driven sympathetic activation and hypoxemia.

### Plan
- Maintain strict systolic blood pressure control (<140 mmHg) using nicardipine infusion.
- Avoid abrupt BP swings; titrate gradually.
- Optimize analgesia; use dexmedetomidine for agitation refractory to pain control.
- Avoid benzodiazepines if possible.
- Maintain HFNC for comfort; avoid unnecessary positive pressure.
- Monitor platelets; transfuse only if <50k or active bleeding.
- Notify attending for sustained SBP >160, uncontrolled agitation, or worsening hypoxemia.

### Attending-Level Clinical Reasoning
**Q:** Why prioritize agitation control?  
**A:** Agitation causes catecholamine surges leading to hypertension, increasing graft wall stress and risk of catastrophic bleeding.

**Q:** Why avoid beta-blockade overnight?  
**A:** Heart rate is not the primary driver of hypertension; goal is smooth BP control without compromising cerebral or renal perfusion.

## Patient 3 — Chronic HeartMate 3 LVAD with Low-Flow Alarms

### Summary
Chronic HM3 LVAD patient admitted with intermittent low-flow alarms, rising LDH, anemia, AKI, and echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction with underfilled LV.

### Assessment
Reduced LVAD flow due to inadequate preload and RV failure physiology. Secondary concern for hemolysis related to suction events rather than primary pump thrombosis.

### Plan
- Maintain Doppler MAP 70–80 mmHg.
- Avoid further diuresis; consider cautious volume resuscitation (250 mL crystalloid) with reassessment.
- Avoid empiric LVAD speed increases due to suction risk.
- Transfuse 1 unit PRBC to support oxygen delivery and preload.
- Monitor hemolysis markers (LDH, plasma-free hemoglobin, bilirubin).
- Consider RV-supportive inotrope (milrinone) if preload optimization insufficient.
- Notify attending for persistent low-flow alarms, rising lactate, or increasing LVAD power.

### Attending-Level Clinical Reasoning
**Q:** Why not increase pump speed?  
**A:** Underfilled LV with septal shift suggests suction physiology; speed increase risks worsening hemolysis and RV preload limitation.

**Q:** Why transfuse at hemoglobin 7.4?  
**A:** In low-flow LVAD physiology, transfusion supports oxygen delivery and preload rather than targeting an isolated numeric threshold.

## Patient 4 — VV-ECMO Day 5 for Severe ARDS

### Summary
VV-ECMO-supported patient with severe ARDS from pneumonia, worsening hypoxemia, rising lactate, AKI with oliguria, thrombocytopenia, and high sedation requirements.

### Assessment
Inadequate systemic oxygen delivery despite adequate ECMO circuit performance, likely due to severe native lung shunt, anemia, volume overload, and metabolic demand rather than oxygenator failure.

### Plan
- Continue lung-protective ventilation; avoid escalation of ventilator pressures.
- Maintain ECMO flow and sweep; adjust sweep primarily for PaCO₂ control.
- Transfuse 1 unit PRBC to improve oxygen delivery.
- Avoid further volume administration; initiate early discussion for CRRT if oliguria persists.
- Continue neuromuscular blockade overnight; reassess daily.
- Monitor for oxygenator dysfunction and bleeding.
- Notify attending for worsening hypoxemia, rising lactate, or circuit concerns.

### Attending-Level Clinical Reasoning
**Q:** Why not change the ECMO circuit?  
**A:** Preserved post-membrane PaO₂ and stable delta-P argue against oxygenator failure; hypoxemia reflects native lung pathology.

**Q:** Why tolerate permissive hypercapnia?  
**A:** Acceptable pH with controlled CO₂ avoids ventilator-induced lung injury and preserves hemodynamic stability.

## Patient 5 — Comfort-Focused Care (End-of-Life)

### Summary
72-year-old male with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy following prolonged CTICU course complicated by refractory cardiogenic shock, multiorgan failure, and poor neurologic recovery. Transitioned to comfort-focused care per goals-of-care discussion.

### Assessment
Primary focus is symptom relief and dignity at end of life. No escalation of life-sustaining therapies.

### Plan
- Maintain low-flow oxygen for comfort only.
- Continue hydromorphone infusion with PRN dosing for pain or dyspnea.
- Administer lorazepam PRN for anxiety or refractory air hunger.
- Use glycopyrrolate PRN for terminal secretions.
- No further labs, imaging, or invasive monitoring.
- Support family presence; offer spiritual and palliative resources.
- Notify attending for uncontrolled symptoms or family distress.

### Attending-Level Clinical Reasoning
**Q:** Why combine opioids and benzodiazepines?  
**A:** In comfort-focused care, combined therapy is appropriate to relieve dyspnea and anxiety and aligns with patient goals.

**Q:** Why discontinue labs and monitoring?  
**A:** Results would not alter management and would not align with comfort-focused goals, risking unnecessary patient distress.
