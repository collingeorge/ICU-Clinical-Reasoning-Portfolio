# Mechanical Ventilation Strategies  
**CTICU Attending-Level Reference**  
Version 1.1 — December 2025

---

# Overview

Mechanical ventilation in the CTICU must balance **lung protection, gas exchange optimization, and cardiac–pulmonary interaction**, particularly in post–cardiac surgery patients, ARDS, and RV failure.  
Ventilator decisions must be individualized and anchored in **pressure–volume mechanics, hemodynamic coupling, and pathophysiology** rather than mode familiarity.

# 1. Fundamental Principles of CTICU Ventilation

### 1.1 Lung-Protective Ventilation
Core tenets (applies to ARDS, aspiration, pulmonary edema, mixed pneumonia):

- **Tidal Volume:** 6 mL/kg IBW (4–6 mL/kg if severe ARDS)  
- **Plateau Pressure:** ≤ 30 cm H₂O  
- **Driving Pressure (ΔP):**  
  **ΔP = Pplat – PEEP**  
  Target **< 14 cm H₂O**; optimal < 12  
- **PEEP:** individualized; goal is alveolar recruitment without overdistension  

### 1.2 Oxygenation Targets
- PaO₂: **55–80 mmHg**  
- SpO₂: **88–95%**  
- Permissive hypoxemia is acceptable unless:
  - Severe anemia  
  - Myocardial ischemia  
  - Elevated ICP  

### 1.3 Permissive Hypercapnia
Acceptable if:
- pH ≥ 7.20  
- No contraindications:
  - Elevated ICP  
  - Severe pulmonary hypertension  
  - RV failure

# 2. Ventilator Modes (Functions & Indications)

## 2.1 Volume-Controlled Ventilation (VCV / PRVC)
- Guarantees tidal volume  
- Primary mode in ARDS, acute respiratory failure, and post-op cardiothoracic patients  
- Facilitates ΔP measurement  

**Advantages:** Predictable Vt; best for lung protection  
**Risks:** High airway pressures in low-compliance states  

---

## 2.2 Pressure-Control Ventilation (PCV)
- Guarantees inspiratory pressure  
- Vt varies with compliance  
- Useful when peak pressures or Pplat are high in VCV  

**Ideal For:**  
- Low-compliance lungs  
- Bronchopleural fistula (limit Vt)  
- Asynchrony unresponsive to sedation  

---

## 2.3 Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)
- Patient-initiated breaths with set support  
- Used primarily for weaning  

**Weaning criteria for PSV:**  
- PEEP ≤ 5–8  
- FiO₂ ≤ 40–50%  
- Comfortable effort, RR < 30  
- Minimal secretions  

---

# 3. Advanced Ventilator Physiology

## 3.1 Understanding Compliance
### Static compliance:
**Cstat = Vt / (Pplat – PEEP)**

Declines with:
- ARDS  
- Pulmonary edema  
- Abdominal hypertension  
- Fibrosis  

Improves with:
- Recruitment  
- Prone positioning  
- Resolution of edema  

---

## 3.2 Assessing Overdistension vs. Recruitment
Use:
- Driving pressure  
- Compliance slope  
- PV curve inflection points  
- Bedside ultrasound (B-lines, real-time recruitment)

**Overdistension:**  
Rising ΔP, rising Pplat, falling compliance

**Recruitment:**  
Improved compliance, reduced ΔP, improved oxygenation  

---

# 4. ARDS Ventilation Strategy (Attending-Level)

## 4.1 Core Strategy
1. Vt 4–6 mL/kg IBW  
2. Pplat ≤ 30  
3. ΔP < 14  
4. Apply **PEEP–FiO₂ tables** (ARDSNet high-PEEP strategy for severe ARDS)  

---

## 4.2 Indications for Prone Positioning
- PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150 on FiO₂ ≥ 60% and PEEP ≥ 10  
- Duration: **≥ 16 hours per session**  
- Benefits: Improved V/Q matching, reduced RV strain, reduced mortality  

---

## 4.3 Neuromuscular Blockade (NMB)
Indications:
- Moderate–severe ARDS (PF < 120)  
- Severe ventilator dyssynchrony unresponsive to sedation  
- Facilitation of lung-protective ventilation  

Duration:  
- Typically 24–48 hours  
- Reassess daily  

---

## 4.4 Rescue Therapies
For refractory hypoxemia (PaO₂ < 55 despite optimized settings):  
- Inhaled vasodilators (iNO, inhaled epoprostenol)  
- Recruitment maneuvers (judicious; avoid routine use)  
- Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV)  
- ECMO consultation (PF < 80 for >6 hours, or PF < 50 for >3 hours)

# 5.1 Right Ventricular Failure (Essential CTICU Content)

### Ventilation goals:
- **Low PEEP**  
- **Low driving pressure**  
- Avoid hyperinflation  
- Avoid hypercapnia (increases PVR)  
- Maintain oxygenation (hypoxia raises PVR)

### Key Point:
**High PEEP and high ΔP increase RV afterload.**

### Targets:
- PEEP 5–8 (unless ARDS physiology warrants more)  
- ΔP < 12  
- Avoid permissive hypercapnia (> 60 mmHg)  

### Supportive Measures:
- Inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone)  
- Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators  
- Optimize preload (avoid both depletion and excess)  

---

# 5.2 Post-Cardiotomy Ventilation

### Unique ICU considerations:
- Reduced lung compliance post-bypass  
- Atelectasis from operative field and fluid shifts  
- Higher incidence of RV dysfunction  
- Higher risk of pulmonary edema  
- Post-op diaphragmatic dysfunction

### Goals:
- Early extubation when feasible  
- Minimize high PEEP in RV dysfunction  
- Use recruitment maneuvers sparingly  
- Maintain adequate oxygenation without aggressive ventilation  

### Airway considerations:
- Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury risk  
- Edema from prolonged intubation or difficult airway  
- Chest tubes affecting mechanical coupling  

---

# 5.3 Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema Ventilation (LV Failure)

### Strategy:
- Modest PEEP (8–12) to reduce venous return and improve LV loading conditions  
- Avoid excessive PEEP that impairs RV function  
- Support with afterload reduction + vasodilators  
- Diuresis is essential (ventilator alone does not fix the pathology)  

---

# 6. Liberation From Mechanical Ventilation

## 6.1 Readiness Criteria
- Hemodynamically stable (minimal or no pressors)  
- Adequate oxygenation:
  - FiO₂ ≤ 50%  
  - PEEP ≤ 5–8  
- Resolving pathology  
- Adequate mentation and secretions  

---

## 6.2 Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT)
Recommended settings:
- PS 5–8  
- PEEP ≤ 5  
- FiO₂ ≤ 40–50%  

### SBT Failure Indicators:
- RR > 35  
- SpO₂ < 88%  
- Tachycardia > 140  
- Increasing work of breathing  
- Dyspnea or diaphoresis  
- Large tidal volumes with rising CO₂ (fatigue)  

---

## 6.3 Post-Extubation Support
- HFNC to reduce reintubation  
- Consider NIV in:
  - COPD  
  - Obesity hypoventilation  
  - Cardiogenic pulmonary edema

# 7. Key Attending-Level Takeaways

1. **Driving pressure is the most important bedside parameter for lung protection.**  
2. **High PEEP improves oxygenation but worsens RV afterload.**  
3. **Ventilator management must incorporate real-time echocardiography.**  
4. **Post-cardiotomy ventilation is a unique physiology — treat the heart as much as the lungs.**  
5. **Proning and NMB are not rescue maneuvers; they are first-line therapies in severe ARDS.**  
6. **The goal is not to “normalize” gas exchange — it is to optimize survival and minimize ventilator injury.**
