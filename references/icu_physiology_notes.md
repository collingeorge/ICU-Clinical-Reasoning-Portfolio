# 1. Cardiovascular Physiology

Critical care decision-making centers on one principle:  
**Tissue perfusion depends on oxygen delivery (DO₂), not blood pressure alone.**

---

## 1.1 Determinants of Cardiac Output (CO)

**CO = HR × SV**, where stroke volume depends on:

### Preload
- End-diastolic volume/pressure  
- Surrogate markers: RAP/CVP, PCWP, IVC variation, LVEDAi (echo)  
- Too much preload → pulmonary edema, septal bowing, worsened RV function  
- Too little → low SV and CO despite normal contractility

### Afterload
- Systemic vascular resistance (SVR), MAP, arterial elastance (Ea)  
- Excessive afterload impairs forward flow, especially in LV systolic dysfunction

### Contractility
- Intrinsic myocardial strength  
- Evaluated by:  
  - LVOT VTI  
  - TAPSE / RV S'  
  - EF (least reliable in shock)  
  - Lactate clearance  
  - SvO₂ / ScvO₂  

**Clinical anchor:**  
A normal EF does *not* exclude shock. Evaluate VTI and perfusion metrics.

---

## 1.2 Perfusion Pressure

### Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)
**MAP = CO × SVR**  
Shock begins when MAP < 65 **or** when DO₂ falls below the metabolic requirement **even if MAP ≥ 65**.

### Organ-Specific Perfusion
- **Brain:** CPP = MAP – ICP (target 60–70 depending on pathology)  
- **Kidneys:** autoregulate between MAP ~65–80  
- **Coronaries:** LV perfusion occurs primarily in diastole; tachycardia reduces perfusion

---

## 1.3 Oxygen Delivery (DO₂) and Consumption (VO₂)

**DO₂ = CO × CaO₂**  
and  
**CaO₂ = (1.34 × Hb × SaO₂) + (0.003 × PaO₂)**

### Critical thresholds
- When DO₂ < VO₂, extraction rises → **ScvO₂ < 65%**  
- Rising lactate = impaired oxygen utilization (not always due to hypoperfusion)  
- Hemoglobin concentration is often the limiting factor in cardiac surgery and sepsis

---

## 1.4 Cardiopulmonary Interaction

Positive-pressure ventilation affects hemodynamics:

### Increases in PEEP
- ↓ venous return → ↓ preload  
- ↑ RV afterload via increased transpulmonary pressure  
- Can precipitate RV failure in:
  - Massive PE  
  - Pulmonary hypertension  
  - Post-cardiotomy RV dysfunction  

### Key principle
**If the RV is failing, treat the RV — not the FiO₂.**  
(Decrease PEEP, optimize preload, reduce driving pressure, consider inhaled pulmonary vasodilators.)

---

# 2. Respiratory Physiology

## 2.1 Mechanics of Ventilation

### Plateau Pressure (Pplat)
- Surrogate for alveolar pressure  
- Target ≤ 30 cm H₂O to avoid volutrauma

### Driving Pressure (ΔP)
**ΔP = Pplat – PEEP**  
- Strongest predictor of mortality in ARDS  
- Goal: **< 14 cm H₂O**, ideally **< 12**

### Compliance
**Cstat = Vt / ΔP**  
- Declining compliance = worsening lung stiffness  
- Rising compliance = improved aeration, reduced edema

---

## 2.2 Oxygenation

Oxygenation depends primarily on:
- FiO₂  
- PEEP (recruitment of alveoli)  
- Shunt fraction  
- V/Q matching  

FiO₂ increases saturate quickly; PEEP changes the physiology.

---

## 2.3 Gas Exchange

### Hypoxemia
Causes:
- Shunt  
- V/Q mismatch  
- Diffusion limitation  
- Hypoventilation  
- Low FiO₂  

### Hypercapnia
Always due to **inadequate alveolar ventilation**.

# 3. Renal Physiology

## 3.1 Perfusion and GFR

Kidney injury in shock is typically **pre-renal** until proven otherwise.

- Kidneys require MAP ≥ 65–70  
- CVP > 12–15 impairs renal perfusion (venous congestion)  
- Urine output is a **late** marker of perfusion

---

## 3.2 Acid–Base Interpretation

Foundation:
- Compensation rules must be satisfied  
- Mixed disorders are common in critical illness

**High-yield formula:**  
**Expected PaCO₂ in metabolic acidosis (Winter’s):**  
PaCO₂ = 1.5 × HCO₃ + 8 ± 2

---

# 4. Neurophysiology

## 4.1 ICP Dynamics

ICP determined by:
- Brain tissue  
- CSF  
- Cerebral blood volume  

Decompensation occurs when compensation mechanisms fail, causing a spike in ICP.

---

## 4.2 Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)

CPP = MAP – ICP  
- TBI target: 60–70  
- SAH with vasospasm risk: often require higher MAP goals  
- CPP must be balanced against systemic hemodynamics

---

# 5. Endocrine and Stress Physiology

- Critical illness induces cortisol resistance and relative adrenal insufficiency  
- Insulin resistance increases  
- Target glucose: 140–180 mg/dL  
- Overly tight control increases mortality

---

# 6. Hematology & Coagulation

## 6.1 Massive Transfusion Principles
- Balanced ratios (1:1:1 or 2:1:1 depending on institution)  
- TEG/ROTEM-directed resuscitation preferable when available

## 6.2 Anticoagulation in the CTICU
- Post-bypass patients often have transient coagulopathy  
- ECMO requires precise anticoagulation to avoid oxygenator clotting or hemorrhage

# Summary

This document reflects the essential physiological frameworks used by CTICU attendings to guide shock management, ventilator strategy, postoperative cardiac care, and neurologic stabilization. These concepts form the foundation for advanced critical care reasoning and must be applied consistently during case interpretation and clinical rounds.
