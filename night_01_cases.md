## Case 1: Post-Operative Hemodynamic Instability

**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Post-operative shock differentiation, cardiac output assessment, surgical bleeding vs. pump failure  
**Complexity Level:** Moderate-High

### Clinical Presentation

**Patient Demographics:**
- Post-operative status (specific surgery context to be determined based on clinical scenario)
- Immediate post-operative period

**Vital Signs:**
- Blood pressure: Hypotensive (specific values: low systolic, narrow pulse pressure suggesting low cardiac output)
- Heart rate: Tachycardic (compensatory response to low cardiac output)
- Cardiac output: Low (based on clinical assessment)
- Lactate: Rising (tissue hypoperfusion marker)
- Urine output: Oliguria likely present

**Physical Examination:**
- General: Post-operative, sedated
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, hypotensive, signs of low cardiac output (cool extremities, delayed capillary refill)
- Chest tube: Active output present (quantification needed to assess bleeding)
- Perfusion: Clinical signs of hypoperfusion

**Key Findings:**
- Chest tube output present (raises concern for hemorrhage)
- Rising lactate (tissue hypoperfusion)
- Low cardiac output physiology
- Hemodynamic instability requiring intervention

### Assessment and Plan

**Problem 1: Hemodynamic Instability - Etiology Undifferentiated**

Assessment: Post-operative patient presenting with hypotension, tachycardia, rising lactate, and low cardiac output physiology. Differential diagnosis includes hypovolemic shock secondary to surgical bleeding, cardiogenic shock from pump failure (myocardial stunning, ischemia, tamponade), or distributive shock from systemic inflammatory response. Chest tube output suggests possible ongoing hemorrhage. Critical to rapidly differentiate between hypovolemia requiring volume resuscitation versus cardiogenic etiology where excessive fluids could be detrimental.

Plan:
- Urgent bedside echocardiography to assess:
  - Left ventricular systolic function and ejection fraction
  - Right ventricular function
  - Presence of pericardial effusion or tamponade physiology
  - Inferior vena cava collapsibility for volume status assessment
  - Valvular function
- Initiate norepinephrine to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg for adequate organ perfusion
- Quantify chest tube output hourly
- Trend hemoglobin/hematocrit every 2-4 hours
- Assess fluid responsiveness with passive leg raise or stroke volume variation if available
- Obtain 12-lead ECG to evaluate for ischemia or arrhythmia
- Review intraoperative course and estimated blood loss

**Problem 2: Suspected Tissue Hypoperfusion**

Assessment: Rising lactate in setting of hemodynamic instability indicates inadequate tissue oxygen delivery. May represent inadequate cardiac output, decreased oxygen-carrying capacity from blood loss, or increased oxygen consumption from physiologic stress.

Plan:
- Serial lactate measurements every 2-4 hours to trend response to resuscitation
- Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg to optimize organ perfusion
- Monitor mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) or central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) if central line present
- Assess end-organ perfusion: urine output (goal >0.5 mL/kg/hr), mental status, skin perfusion
- Target lactate clearance >10% within 2 hours as marker of adequate resuscitation

**Problem 3: Post-Operative Bleeding vs. Pump Failure (Cardiogenic Shock)**

Assessment: Must rapidly differentiate hemorrhagic shock from cardiogenic shock as management strategies differ significantly. Chest tube output suggests possible surgical bleeding requiring potential return to OR. However, low cardiac output state could also represent myocardial dysfunction, particularly if cardiac surgery or prolonged procedure with significant fluid shifts.

Plan:
- Quantitative assessment of chest tube output (>100 mL/hr for 2-3 consecutive hours may warrant surgical re-exploration)
- Bedside echo as above to assess cardiac function
- Surgical consultation for evaluation if bleeding suspected
- Coagulation panel: PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, platelet count
- Rule out cardiac tamponade (Beck's triad: hypotension, muffled heart sounds, JVD; equalization of pressures on echo)
- If cardiogenic shock confirmed, consider inotropic support (dobutamine, milrinone) rather than aggressive volume resuscitation
- If hemorrhagic shock, prepare for potential massive transfusion protocol

**Problem 4: Sedation and Analgesia Balance in Hemodynamically Unstable Patient**

Assessment: Adequate analgesia is essential for patient comfort and to prevent sympathetic surge, but sedative and analgesic agents can exacerbate hypotension through vasodilation and myocardial depression. Must carefully titrate to balance comfort with hemodynamic stability.

Plan:
- Optimize analgesia with multimodal approach to minimize opioid requirements
- Consider shorter-acting agents (fentanyl boluses vs. infusion) to allow rapid titration
- If sedation required, use agents with minimal hemodynamic effects (dexmedetomidine if appropriate, though avoid if bradycardic)
- Hold or minimize propofol if hypotensive (significant vasodilatory effects)
- Frequent reassessment of sedation level (RASS score) and hemodynamic response
- Treat pain first, then anxiety, to avoid sympathetic response that increases oxygen demand

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**

This case emphasizes the critical importance of rapidly differentiating shock etiologies in the post-operative setting. The presence of chest tube output raises concern for hemorrhagic shock, but low cardiac output physiology could equally represent cardiogenic shock from myocardial dysfunction or cardiac tamponade. Bedside echocardiography is the key diagnostic tool to guide management. The lactate trend provides objective evidence of tissue perfusion adequacy. Management must be tailored to the specific shock etiology: volume resuscitation for hemorrhage, inotropic support for pump failure, or pericardiocentesis for tamponade. The sedation and analgesia challenge highlights the need to balance patient comfort with hemodynamic stability in critically ill patients.

## Case 2: DNI Patient with Dyspnea on BiPAP

**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Goals of care, comfort-focused management, non-invasive ventilation strategies, end-of-life symptom management  
**Complexity Level:** Moderate

### Clinical Presentation

**Patient Demographics:**
- Elderly patient
- Code status: DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate)
- Underlying conditions: COPD, likely additional comorbidities

**Vital Signs:**
- Respiratory rate: Elevated (severe dyspnea)
- Oxygen saturation: Hypoxemic
- Work of breathing: Significantly increased

**Physical Examination:**
- General: Severe dyspnea, air hunger, anxious appearance
- Respiratory: Increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use, likely decreased breath sounds or crackles depending on pneumonia location
- Mental status: Alert but distressed

**Current Therapy:**
- BiPAP: Poor tolerance, patient unable to maintain therapy
- Antibiotics: Initiated for pneumonia

**Key Findings:**
- Severe dyspnea with air hunger
- BiPAP intolerance (interface discomfort, anxiety, claustrophobia)
- Pneumonia on imaging
- DNI status limiting escalation options
- Anxiety contributing to respiratory distress

### Assessment and Plan

**Problem 1: Severe Dyspnea with Air Hunger**

Assessment: Elderly DNI patient with pneumonia-associated hypoxemic respiratory failure experiencing severe dyspnea and air hunger. BiPAP intolerance limits non-invasive ventilation options, and DNI status precludes intubation. Air hunger represents one of the most distressing symptoms at end-of-life and requires aggressive palliative management. Dyspnea is multifactorial: hypoxemia, increased work of breathing, anxiety, and possibly air trapping from underlying COPD.

Plan:
- Low-dose opioid therapy for dyspnea relief:
  - Morphine 2-5 mg IV/SC every 2-4 hours, titrate to comfort
  - Opioids reduce perception of dyspnea and decrease respiratory drive
  - Monitor for respiratory depression, though comfort takes precedence given DNI status
- Trial of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) as alternative to BiPAP:
  - Better tolerated interface (less claustrophobic)
  - Provides PEEP effect, washes out dead space, delivers heated/humidified oxygen
  - Start at 40-60 L/min, FiO2 titrated to comfort and target SpO2
- Cool air/fan directed at face (can reduce dyspnea sensation)
- Positioning: elevate head of bed, allow patient to find position of comfort
- Minimize exertion and energy expenditure

**Problem 2: Poor Tolerance of Non-Invasive Ventilation**

Assessment: BiPAP intolerance is common in elderly patients and those with anxiety, claustrophobia, or inability to cooperate with therapy. The tight-fitting mask can increase distress and sense of air hunger paradoxically. Alternative strategies needed that align with patient comfort while providing respiratory support within DNI limitations.

Plan:
- Discontinue BiPAP given poor tolerance and patient distress
- Trial HFNC as above (significantly better tolerated)
- If HFNC also not tolerated, simple facemask or nasal cannula at comfort-focused oxygen delivery
- Prioritize patient comfort over oxygen saturation targets
- Document goals of care: emphasis on symptom management rather than physiologic targets
- Avoid repeated attempts to force BiPAP compliance (increases distress)

**Problem 3: Anxiety and Psychological Distress**

Assessment: Severe dyspnea generates profound anxiety, creating vicious cycle where anxiety worsens dyspnea perception. Patient distress from air hunger, awareness of worsening condition, and possible existential concerns about dying. Anxiety management is critical component of dyspnea treatment.

Plan:
- Benzodiazepines for anxiety:
  - Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg IV/PO every 4-6 hours as needed
  - Can be combined with opioids for refractory dyspnea
- Non-pharmacologic interventions:
  - Calm, reassuring presence at bedside
  - Frequent communication with patient and family
  - Chaplain or spiritual care if desired
  - Minimize stimulation, quiet environment
  - Familiar items from home if possible

**Problem 4: Goals of Care Communication**

Assessment: DNI status is established, but degree of other interventions (antibiotics, vasopressors, dialysis) and transition to purely comfort-focused care requires clarification. Family and patient need clear understanding of prognosis and treatment options within DNI framework.

Plan:
- Family meeting within 24 hours to discuss:
  - Current clinical status and trajectory
  - Prognosis with and without treatment escalation
  - Patient's goals, values, and preferences
  - What comfort-focused care means in this context
  - Timeline and expectations
- Palliative care consultation for expert symptom management and goals of care discussion
- Continue antibiotics for now (non-invasive, may provide benefit)
- Provide reassurance without false hope:
  - Acknowledge severity of illness
  - Commit to ensuring comfort
  - Explain interventions focused on quality of life
  - Offer support to family
- Document clear plan aligned with patient wishes
- Consider transition to hospice if appropriate

**Problem 5: Hypoxemia in Context of DNI Status**

Assessment: Hypoxemia contributing to dyspnea, but oxygen saturation targets should be guided by patient comfort rather than arbitrary numerical goals. In DNI patient with severe pneumonia, some degree of hypoxemia is expected and acceptable if patient is comfortable.

Plan:
- Titrate oxygen to patient comfort, not to specific SpO2 target
- HFNC trial may improve oxygenation and comfort simultaneously
- Continue antibiotics for pneumonia treatment
- If patient remains comfortable with SpO2 in 80s-low 90s, this is acceptable
- Frequent reassessment of patient comfort level
- Avoid excessive focus on monitor alarms (can increase family/staff anxiety)

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**

This case highlights the critical importance of aligning medical interventions with patient values and goals of care. The DNI status fundamentally changes the treatment paradigm from life-prolonging to comfort-focused care. BiPAP intolerance in this context is not a "failure" but rather an indication that the intervention is not meeting the patient's needs. The shift to HFNC represents an attempt to provide both physiologic support and patient comfort. Low-dose opioids are evidence-based for dyspnea management and should not be withheld due to concerns about respiratory depression in a DNI patient—comfort is the primary goal. The case emphasizes honest communication with patients and families about prognosis while maintaining hope in the form of excellent symptom management. Palliative care involvement ensures expert guidance in managing distressing symptoms while honoring patient autonomy.

## Case 3: Worsening Septic Shock

**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Refractory distributive shock, vasopressor escalation, source control, early AKI management  
**Complexity Level:** Moderate-High

### Clinical Presentation

**Patient Demographics:**
- Patient with septic shock requiring ICU-level care

**Vital Signs:**
- Blood pressure: Hypotensive despite escalating norepinephrine
- Heart rate: Likely tachycardic
- Lactate: Rising (worsening tissue hypoperfusion)
- Urine output: Oliguria (early acute kidney injury)

**Physical Examination:**
- General: Critically ill appearance
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, hypotensive, possible bounding pulses (high cardiac output distributive shock)
- Skin: Mottling present (severe perfusion deficit, marker of poor prognosis)
- Extremities: Peripheral hypoperfusion

**Laboratory Values:**
- Lactate: Elevated and rising
- Likely elevated white blood cell count or leukopenia
- Creatinine: Rising (acute kidney injury)
- Procalcitonin: Likely elevated

**Key Findings:**
- Septic shock with escalating vasopressor requirements
- Rising lactate despite initial resuscitation
- Mottling (ominous sign)
- Oliguria and early AKI
- Risk of progression to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

### Assessment and Plan

**Problem 1: Refractory Distributive Shock Secondary to Sepsis**

Assessment: Patient meets criteria for septic shock with hypotension requiring vasopressors and elevated lactate. Despite initial resuscitation efforts, patient demonstrates worsening hemodynamics with escalating norepinephrine requirements and rising lactate, indicating refractory shock. Mottling is a particularly concerning finding associated with increased mortality and represents severe microcirculatory dysfunction. The distributive shock physiology results from vasodilation, capillary leak, and myocardial depression. Inadequate response to single-agent vasopressor therapy necessitates escalation and reassessment of source control.

Plan:
- Add vasopressin 0.03-0.04 units/min as second-line vasopressor:
  - Vasopressin works through V1 receptors, different mechanism from norepinephrine (alpha-1 adrenergic)
  - Restores vasopressor responsiveness in catecholamine-refractory shock
  - May allow decrease in norepinephrine dose
  - Vasopressin deficiency is common in septic shock
- Continue titrating norepinephrine to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg
- Consider arterial line placement if not already present for continuous blood pressure monitoring
- Evaluate hemodynamics with bedside point-of-care ultrasound:
  - Assess cardiac function (may have septic cardiomyopathy)
  - Evaluate fluid responsiveness (IVC collapsibility, stroke volume variation)
  - Rule out other shock etiologies (tamponade, massive PE)
- If MAP goals not met with norepinephrine + vasopressin, consider adding epinephrine or phenylephrine
- Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours if refractory shock (consider stress-dose steroids)
- Serial lactate measurements every 2-4 hours to assess response to therapy

**Problem 2: Severe Perfusion Deficit with Mottling**

Assessment: Mottling represents severe microcirculatory dysfunction and is a powerful predictor of mortality in septic shock. The mottling score correlates with severity of illness and risk of death. Rising lactate confirms inadequate tissue oxygen delivery despite macrocirculatory resuscitation (maintaining MAP). This suggests microcirculatory failure where oxygen is not reaching cellular level despite adequate blood pressure.

Plan:
- Optimize oxygen delivery:
  - Maintain hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL (consider higher target of 9 g/dL given severe shock)
  - Ensure adequate oxygenation (SpO2 ≥ 92%)
  - Optimize cardiac output (see inotrope discussion below)
- Document mottling score (knee, lower thigh, upper thigh, upper arm, shoulder) for prognostication
- Frequent reassessment of peripheral perfusion (capillary refill, skin temperature)
- Lactate clearance as resuscitation endpoint
- Consider invasive cardiac output monitoring if available (PICCO, PA catheter) to optimize hemodynamics
- Early discussions with family regarding prognosis given severity of illness

**Problem 3: Fluid Responsiveness vs. Fluid Overload**

Assessment: Patient with septic shock has likely received significant fluid resuscitation during initial management. However, with rising lactate and worsening perfusion, must determine if additional fluids would improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion or contribute to pulmonary edema and organ dysfunction. Many septic shock patients are fluid unresponsive after initial resuscitation, and excessive fluids worsen outcomes.

Plan:
- Bedside ultrasound assessment of fluid responsiveness:
  - IVC diameter and collapsibility with respiration
  - Passive leg raise (PLR) test with stroke volume measurement
  - Pulse pressure variation or stroke volume variation if mechanically ventilated
- If fluid responsive (stroke volume increases >10-15% with PLR):
  - Administer 500 mL crystalloid bolus
  - Reassess clinical response
- If not fluid responsive:
  - Avoid additional fluids (will worsen edema without improving perfusion)
  - Focus on vasopressor optimization
  - Consider inotropic support if cardiac output is low

**Problem 4: Possible Low Cardiac Output Component - Consider Inotrope**

Assessment: While septic shock is typically characterized by high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance, septic cardiomyopathy is common and can result in decreased cardiac output. If cardiac output is inadequate despite adequate preload and afterload (MAP), inotropic support may improve tissue perfusion.

Plan:
- Bedside echocardiography to assess:
  - Left ventricular systolic function
  - Right ventricular function (often impaired in sepsis)
  - Valvular function
- If cardiac output low or ventricular function depressed:
  - Consider dobutamine 2.5-5 mcg/kg/min, titrate to effect (max 20 mcg/kg/min)
  - Monitor for tachycardia and arrhythmias
  - May improve oxygen delivery by increasing cardiac output
  - Can be synergistic with vasopressors
- Alternative: milrinone if dobutamine not tolerated, though more complex in hypotensive patient

**Problem 5: Source Control Evaluation**

Assessment: Adequate source control is fundamental to septic shock management and outcomes. Without source control, antibiotics and supportive care alone may be insufficient. Common sources requiring intervention include abscesses (requiring drainage), infected lines/devices (requiring removal), ischemic bowel (requiring surgery), or obstructed/infected urinary tract (requiring decompression).

Plan:
- Comprehensive source identification:
  - Review imaging for abscesses, collections, or visceral perforation
  - Examine all indwelling devices (central lines, Foley catheter, drains) as potential sources
  - Reassess surgical history for anastomotic leaks or intra-abdominal pathology
- Urgent surgical consultation if source requires operative intervention
- Remove or replace potentially infected devices
- Repeat imaging if source unclear and patient deteriorating
- If intra-abdominal source suspected, consider CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast
- Interventional radiology consultation for percutaneous drainage if abscess identified

**Problem 6: Early Acute Kidney Injury**

Assessment: Oliguria in setting of septic shock represents acute kidney injury, likely multifactorial from hypoperfusion (acute tubular necrosis), inflammatory injury, and possible nephrotoxic medications. AKI in septic shock is associated with increased mortality and may require renal replacement therapy if progressive.

Plan:
- Optimize renal perfusion by maintaining MAP ≥ 65 mmHg (some patients may need higher MAP target)
- Strict intake/output monitoring with hourly urine output measurement
- Avoid nephrotoxic agents when possible (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides unless essential)
- Daily creatinine and electrolyte monitoring
- Adjust medication dosing for renal function
- Consider renal replacement therapy (CRRT) if:
  - Refractory volume overload
  - Severe metabolic acidosis
  - Hyperkalemia refractory to medical management
  - Uremia with clinical manifestations
- Diuretics unlikely to be effective in oliguric AKI with septic shock

**Problem 7: Broad-Spectrum Antibiotic Therapy**

Assessment: Septic shock requires prompt, appropriate antibiotic therapy targeted at likely pathogens. Empiric broad-spectrum coverage should be initiated within one hour of septic shock recognition (Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines). Antibiotics should be narrowed once culture data available.

Plan:
- Continue current broad-spectrum antibiotics (specific regimen depends on suspected source and local antibiogram)
- Typical empiric coverage might include:
  - Vancomycin for gram-positive coverage including MRSA
  - Piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage
  - Consider adding antifungal if risk factors present
- Review culture data daily and narrow antibiotics based on sensitivities
- Source control as above remains critical
- Procalcitonin trending to assess response to therapy and guide duration

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**

This case demonstrates the management of refractory septic shock, where initial resuscitation has been inadequate. The rising lactate and mottling are ominous signs requiring aggressive intervention. The addition of vasopressin as a second-line agent reflects current critical care practice for vasopressor-refractory shock. The case emphasizes the importance of assessing fluid responsiveness rather than empirically administering fluids—many septic patients are harmed by excessive resuscitation. Source control evaluation is paramount; without removing the infection source, even optimal supportive care may fail. The development of AKI represents early organ dysfunction, highlighting the risk of progression to MODS. Inotropic support may be necessary if septic cardiomyopathy is present. This case integrates hemodynamic management, source control, antibiotic therapy, and organ support—the core principles of septic shock management.

## Case 4: Rib Fractures with Respiratory Impairment

**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Trauma pain management, regional anesthesia techniques, prevention of pulmonary complications, multimodal analgesia  
**Complexity Level:** Moderate

### Clinical Presentation

**Patient Demographics:**
- Trauma patient
- Mechanism: Motorcycle accident
- Injuries: Multiple rib fractures

**Vital Signs:**
- Respiratory rate: Tachypneic (pain-induced shallow breathing)
- Oxygen saturation: Likely decreased due to hypoventilation and atelectasis
- Pain score: Severe (limiting respiratory mechanics)

**Physical Examination:**
- General: Acute distress from pain
- Respiratory: Shallow breathing pattern, decreased chest wall excursion, splinting
- Chest: Point tenderness over rib fractures, crepitus possible, decreased breath sounds at bases
- Neurologic: Otherwise intact (no spinal cord injury assumed)

**Imaging:**
- Chest X-ray or CT: Multiple rib fractures
- Possible pulmonary contusion
- Atelectasis (volume loss from poor inspiratory effort)

**Key Findings:**
- Severe pain limiting respiratory mechanics
- Shallow breathing with hypoventilation
- Atelectasis developing from inadequate lung expansion
- Risk of pneumonia from poor secretion clearance
- Potential need for surgical intervention requiring pre-operative optimization

### Assessment and Plan

**Problem 1: Pain-Induced Hypoventilation**

Assessment: Multiple rib fractures result in severe chest wall pain that causes splinting and shallow breathing. Patients avoid deep inspiration due to pain, leading to reduced tidal volumes, atelectasis, hypoxemia, and CO2 retention. This pain-ventilation-atelectasis cycle is the primary driver of respiratory complications in rib fracture patients. Inadequate pain control is associated with increased risk of pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and prolonged hospital stay. Aggressive multimodal analgesia is essential to break this cycle.

Plan:
- **Regional anesthesia techniques** (gold standard for rib fracture pain):
  - Serratus anterior plane block (targets lateral rib fractures, ribs 2-9)
  - Paravertebral nerve blocks (targets specific dermatomes, can be placed at multiple levels)
  - Thoracic epidural analgesia (most effective for multiple rib fractures, provides dense bilateral analgesia)
    - Consider epidural placement if ≥3 rib fractures or if oral/IV analgesia inadequate
    - Provides superior analgesia compared to systemic opioids
    - Enables effective coughing and deep breathing
    - Contraindications: coagulopathy, hemodynamic instability, spinal injury
- **Multimodal systemic analgesia** to minimize opioid requirements:
  - Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO/IV every 6 hours (scheduled, not PRN)
  - NSAIDs: ketorolac 15-30 mg IV every 6 hours (if not contraindicated by renal function or bleeding risk)
  - Gabapentin 300-600 mg PO three times daily (neuropathic component, opioid-sparing)
  - Lidocaine patch to chest wall if tolerated
- **Opioid analgesia** as needed despite multimodal approach:
  - IV opioids (morphine, hydromorphone, or fentanyl) titrated to pain relief
  - Consider patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for autonomy and consistent analgesia
  - Goal: pain score <4/10 to enable effective respiratory effort
- Frequent pain reassessment every 2-4 hours
- Optimize analgesia before respiratory therapy interventions

**Problem 2: Atelectasis and Risk of Pneumonia**

Assessment: Shallow breathing from pain leads to dependent atelectasis, particularly in lower lobes. Atelectasis reduces functional residual capacity, causes ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and creates ideal environment for pneumonia development. Mucus plugging from inadequate cough effort further contributes. Prevention of pneumonia is critical to avoid respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation.

Plan:
- **Aggressive pulmonary hygiene:**
  - Incentive spirometry every 1-2 hours while awake
    - Goal: 10 deep breaths per session
    - Requires adequate analgesia to perform effectively
  - Respiratory therapy consultation for:
    - Chest physiotherapy
    - Assisted coughing techniques
    - Flutter valve or positive expiratory pressure (PEP) device
    - Nasotracheal suctioning if unable to clear secretions
- **Positioning:**
  - Elevate head of bed 30-45 degrees
  - Frequent position changes (every 2 hours)
  - Encourage mobilization as tolerated (sitting in chair, ambulation if stable)
- **Supplemental oxygen:**
  - High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) if hypoxemic
  - Provides positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) effect to maintain alveolar recruitment
  - Better tolerated than BiPAP in trauma patients
- **Monitor for pneumonia development:**
  - Serial chest X-rays every 24-48 hours
  - Fever curve monitoring
  - Sputum culture if productive cough develops
  - White blood cell count trending
  - Low threshold for antibiotics if pneumonia suspected

**Problem 3: Ventilation Compromise - Risk of Respiratory Failure**

Assessment: If pain control inadequate or pulmonary injury significant (contusion, hemothorax, pneumothorax), patient may progress to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Intubation and positive pressure ventilation in patient with rib fractures carries risk of pneumothorax or worsening of existing pulmonary contusion. Prevention of respiratory failure through optimal pain control and pulmonary hygiene is paramount.

Plan:
- Close monitoring of respiratory status:
  - Continuous pulse oximetry
  - Respiratory rate trending (tachypnea >30 may indicate impending failure)
  - Serial arterial blood gases if concern for hypercarbia or hypoxemia
  - Work of breathing assessment (accessory muscle use, paradoxical breathing)
- Intubation criteria:
  - Hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen (PaO2 <60 mmHg on high-flow oxygen)
  - Hypercarbia with respiratory acidosis (pH <7.25, PaCO2 >50-60 mmHg and rising)
  - Altered mental status from hypoxemia or hypercarbia
  - Inability to protect airway or clear secretions
  - Exhaustion with impending respiratory arrest
- HFNC as bridge therapy:
  - Start at 40-60 L/min, FiO2 titrated to SpO2 >92%
  - Provides PEEP, reduces work of breathing
  - May prevent intubation if instituted early
- If intubation required:
  - Use lung-protective ventilation (tidal volume 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight)
  - Adequate PEEP to prevent atelectasis
  - Careful plateau pressure monitoring (<30 cmH2O) to avoid pneumothorax
  - Early extubation as soon as able (prolonged ventilation increases complications)

**Problem 4: Pre-Operative Optimization (If Surgical Intervention Needed)**

Assessment: Patient may require operative fixation of rib fractures (surgical stabilization of rib fractures, SSRF) if flail chest, severe displacement, or failure of conservative management. Alternatively, may need other surgical interventions for associated injuries. Pre-operative optimization of pulmonary status is critical to minimize post-operative complications and facilitate early extubation.

Plan:
- **Pre-operative goals:**
  - Pain score <4/10 with effective coughing ability
  - SpO2 >92% on minimal supplemental oxygen
  - Clear chest X-ray or stable/improving atelectasis
  - Ability to take deep breaths with incentive spirometry
  - Adequate airway clearance
- **Communication with anesthesiology:**
  - Discuss regional anesthesia plan (epidural placement if not already present)
  - Anesthetic technique to minimize respiratory depression
  - Post-operative pain management strategy
  - Post-operative disposition (likely ICU for close monitoring)
- **Pre-operative preparation:**
  - Continue multimodal analgesia through morning of surgery
  - Ensure epidural or regional blocks functioning optimally
  - Respiratory therapy optimization
  - Optimize volume status (avoid overload which worsens gas exchange)
  - Correct coagulopathy if present
- **Post-operative plan:**
* Early extubation if possible (plan for awake intubation or rapid extubation)
* Aggressive pain control continuation
* Immediate resumption of pulmonary hygiene
* Close ICU monitoring for 24-48 hours minimum

### Problem 5: Associated Injuries and Complications
**Assessment:** Motorcycle trauma often results in polytrauma. In addition to rib fractures, patient may have pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, hemothorax, solid organ injury, or long bone fractures. Each complicates respiratory management and increases risk of complications.

**Plan:**

* Comprehensive trauma evaluation:
  * Review CT chest for pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, hemothorax
  * CT abdomen/pelvis for solid organ injury
  * Skeletal survey for other fractures

* Monitor for complications:
  * Pneumothorax: serial chest X-rays, sudden desaturation should prompt immediate evaluation
  * Hemothorax: chest tube if significant, monitor output
  * Pulmonary contusion: worsens over 24-48 hours, manage conservatively with pulmonary hygiene
  * Fat embolism: typically occurs 24-72 hours post-injury, presents with hypoxemia, confusion, petechiae

* Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis:
  * Sequential compression devices
  * Pharmacologic prophylaxis (enoxaparin or heparin) when bleeding risk acceptable
  * Early mobilization

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**
This case highlights the critical importance of aggressive pain management in chest wall trauma to prevent the pain-hypoventilation-atelectasis-pneumonia cascade. Regional anesthesia techniques are the gold standard and should be considered early in any patient with multiple rib fractures. The serratus anterior plane block and paravertebral blocks provide excellent analgesia with minimal systemic effects, while thoracic epidural offers the most complete pain relief for severe injuries. Multimodal analgesia reduces opioid requirements and associated side effects (respiratory depression, constipation, sedation). Pulmonary hygiene with incentive spirometry and respiratory therapy is essential but requires adequate analgesia to perform effectively. HFNC can serve as a valuable bridge therapy to prevent intubation. The case emphasizes prevention of complications through proactive management rather than reactive treatment of respiratory failure. Pre-operative optimization ensures the best possible outcome if surgical intervention is required.

* Young patient (age suggestive of otherwise healthy individual)
* Acute presentation

**Diagnosis:**
* Fulminant viral myocarditis (presumed or confirmed)

**Vital Signs:**
* Blood pressure: Severely hypotensive
* Heart rate: Variable (may be tachycardic or relatively bradycardic if myocardial stunning severe)
* Perfusion markers: Poor (cool extremities, altered mental status, oliguria)
* Lactate: Rising (severe tissue hypoperfusion)

**Cardiac Function:**
* Ejection fraction: 15% (severe systolic dysfunction)
* Clinical evidence of cardiogenic shock

**Physical Examination:**
* General: Critically ill, possible altered mental status from hypoperfusion
* Cardiovascular: Hypotensive, tachycardic or bradycardic, displaced PMI, S3 gallop likely, elevated JVP
* Respiratory: Possible pulmonary edema (crackles), tachypnea
* Extremities: Cool, mottled, delayed capillary refill
* Urine output: Oliguria or anuria

**Key Findings:**
* Severely depressed left ventricular function (EF 15%)
* Refractory cardiogenic shock despite medical management
* Multi-organ hypoperfusion (rising lactate, altered mental status, oliguria)
* Young patient with potentially reversible condition (viral myocarditis)
* ECMO candidacy assessment urgently needed

#### Assessment and Plan
**Problem 1: Refractory Cardiogenic Shock Secondary to Fulminant Myocarditis**  
**Assessment:** Young patient with fulminant myocarditis presenting with severe cardiogenic shock characterized by profoundly depressed cardiac output (EF 15%), hypotension, rising lactate, and end-organ hypoperfusion. Fulminant myocarditis typically presents with acute severe hemodynamic compromise but paradoxically has better long-term prognosis than acute myocarditis if patient survives acute phase—many recover normal or near-normal cardiac function. However, the acute phase carries extremely high mortality without mechanical circulatory support. Patient has failed medical management (vasopressor therapy insufficient) and requires urgent evaluation for mechanical circulatory support, specifically VA-ECMO (veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).

**Plan:**
* Escalate vasopressor support as bridge to mechanical circulatory support:
  * Add vasopressin 0.03-0.04 units/min to current norepinephrine
  * Vasopressin provides additional vasopressor support through non-adrenergic mechanism
  * May allow reduction in norepinephrine dose (high-dose catecholamines worsen myocardial oxygen consumption)
* Inotropic support:
  * Dobutamine 2.5-10 mcg/kg/min to augment cardiac output
  * Milrinone 0.125-0.75 mcg/kg/min as alternative (phosphodiesterase inhibitor, inodilator)
  * Balance improved contractility against increased myocardial oxygen demand
  * Both can worsen hypotension; may need concurrent vasopressor escalation
* Goal-directed therapy:
  * Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg (may need higher target given severity)
  * Optimize cardiac output and end-organ perfusion
  * Minimize myocardial oxygen demand
* Avoid excessive fluids:
  * Cardiogenic shock patients poorly tolerate volume loading
  * Pulmonary edema from elevated left-sided filling pressures
  * Use diuretics cautiously if volume overloaded (but maintain adequate preload)

**Problem 2: Multi-Organ Hypoperfusion**  
**Assessment:** Rising lactate, oliguria, and likely altered mental status represent severe multi-organ hypoperfusion from critically low cardiac output. This constitutes cardiogenic shock with MODS (multi-organ dysfunction syndrome). Without rapid restoration of adequate cardiac output, irreversible organ injury will occur. Time-sensitive situation requiring immediate advanced support.

**Plan:**
* Aggressive monitoring:
  * Arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring (essential for vasopressor/inotrope titration)
  * Central venous catheter for central venous pressure monitoring and medication delivery
  * Consider pulmonary artery catheter for precise hemodynamic assessment:
    * Cardiac output/cardiac index measurement
    * Pulmonary artery pressures
    * Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2)
    * Systemic vascular resistance calculation
  * Continuous EKG monitoring for arrhythmias
* Serial lactate measurements every 1-2 hours to assess adequacy of resuscitation
* End-organ function monitoring:
  * Hourly urine output (Foley catheter essential)
  * Mental status assessment
  * Liver function tests (hepatic congestion from right heart failure)
  * Trending creatinine for renal function
* Bedside echocardiography (repeat frequently):
  * Assess ventricular function
  * Evaluate for complications (new valvular regurgitation, ventricular thrombus, pericardial effusion)
  * Guide fluid management
  * Assess response to inotropes

**Problem 3: ECMO Candidacy Assessment - Urgent Evaluation Required**  
**Assessment:** Patient meets criteria for consideration of VA-ECMO (veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) given refractory cardiogenic shock with evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion despite maximal medical therapy. VA-ECMO can provide complete hemodynamic support, allowing myocardial recovery in fulminant myocarditis while preventing irreversible end-organ damage. However, ECMO is resource-intensive, has significant complications, and requires careful patient selection. Favorable factors for this patient include young age, potentially reversible etiology (viral myocarditis often recovers), and lack of pre-existing multi-organ failure.

**Plan:**
* Urgent heart failure/cardiac critical care consultation
* Urgent ECMO team consultation for candidacy assessment
* Patient selection considerations:
  * Favorable: Young age, acute reversible process, no significant comorbidities
  * Assess for contraindications:
    * Irreversible neurologic injury
    * Severe irreversible multi-organ failure
    * Malignancy with poor prognosis
    * Severe peripheral vascular disease (limits cannulation)
    * Aortic regurgitation (contraindication to VA-ECMO without venting)
    * Advanced directives against aggressive care
* Prepare for VA-ECMO cannulation:
  * Central cannulation (femoral vein and artery most common for VA-ECMO)
  * OR or cardiac catheterization lab depending on institutional protocol
  * Obtain vascular ultrasound to assess femoral vessels
  * Type and cross for blood products
  * Correct coagulopathy if present
  * ICU bed prepared for ECMO management
* Alternative/adjunctive mechanical support options:
  * Impella CP or 5.0 (percutaneous left ventricular assist device)
    * Can be used alone or with VA-ECMO (ECPELLA strategy)
    * Provides LV venting if on VA-ECMO (prevents pulmonary edema)
  * Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)
    * Less support than Impella or ECMO but easier to place
    * May be insufficient for this degree of shock

**Problem 4: Myocarditis-Specific Management**  
**Assessment:** Fulminant myocarditis is often viral in etiology (coxsackievirus, adenovirus, parvovirus B19, COVID-19, others) but can also be autoimmune, toxic (medications, cocaine), or giant cell myocarditis. Endomyocardial biopsy provides definitive diagnosis but is often deferred in unstable patients. Supportive care is mainstay; specific antiviral therapy rarely indicated. Immunosuppression controversial except in specific subtypes (giant cell, eosinophilic).

**Plan:**
* Diagnostic workup:
  * Viral PCR panel (blood, potentially myocardial tissue if biopsy performed)
  * COVID-19 testing
  * Autoimmune workup: ANA, RF, complement levels
  * Troponin trending (typically markedly elevated)
  * BNP/NT-proBNP
  * ECG: may show diffuse ST elevations, PR depression, conduction abnormalities
  * Consider cardiac MRI when stable (shows myocardial edema, inflammation, late gadolinium enhancement)
* Endomyocardial biopsy:
  * Defer if too unstable
  * Consider once on mechanical support if diagnosis unclear
  * Can guide immunosuppression decisions in some cases
* Supportive care:
  * Hemodynamic support as above
  * Mechanical circulatory support (ECMO)
  * Arrhythmia monitoring and management
  * Avoid medications that further depress myocardial function
* Immunosuppression:
  * Generally not indicated for viral myocarditis
  * Consider in giant cell myocarditis or autoimmune etiology (requires biopsy confirmation)
  * Steroids: methylprednisolone, IVIG in some protocols
* Long-term considerations:
  * Many patients with fulminant myocarditis recover normal or near-normal function
  * Bridge to recovery with ECMO is goal
  * If no recovery, may require durable LVAD or heart transplant evaluation

**Problem 5: Preparation for Possible VA-ECMO Cannulation**  
**Assessment:** Given severity of shock and inadequate response to medical therapy, VA-ECMO placement is imminent. Pre-cannulation preparation is essential to optimize outcomes and minimize complications.

**Plan:**
* Pre-procedural checklist:
  * Obtain informed consent from patient (if able) or family/surrogate
  * Explain ECMO: temporary support, goal is myocardial recovery, potential complications
  * Discuss goals of care and code status (full code required for ECMO)
  * Review advanced directives
* Laboratory preparation:
  * Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel
  * Coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen)
  * Type and cross match for packed red blood cells (4-6 units)
  * Blood gas analysis
* Imaging:
  * Chest X-ray (baseline)
  * Vascular ultrasound of cannulation sites
  * Echocardiography (pre-ECMO baseline)
* Medications:
  * Ensure adequate sedation and analgesia for procedure
  * Antibiotics: prophylactic dose pre-cannulation
  * Heparin: will need systemic anticoagulation on ECMO
* Family communication:
  * Update family on clinical status and need for ECMO
  * Explain procedure, risks, and expected course
  * Prepare for ICU stay of days to weeks
  * Discuss realistic outcomes and potential for recovery

**Problem 6: Arrhythmia Risk**  
**Assessment:** Myocarditis is highly arrhythmogenic due to myocardial inflammation, edema, and electrical instability. Patients are at risk for ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and complete heart block. Arrhythmias can further compromise already tenuous hemodynamics.

**Plan:**
* Continuous telemetry monitoring
* Electrolyte optimization (potassium >4.0, magnesium >2.0)
* Avoid QT-prolonging medications
* Amiodarone readily available for ventricular arrhythmias
* Temporary pacing capability at bedside if bradyarrhythmias occur
* Defibrillator pads in place
* Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) drugs immediately available
* Consider prophylactic amiodarone if frequent ectopy or non-sustained VT

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**
This case represents one of the most time-sensitive and high-stakes scenarios in critical care medicine. Fulminant myocarditis in a young patient is potentially reversible but requires aggressive mechanical circulatory support to bridge to recovery. The patient's age and lack of significant comorbidities make them an excellent ECMO candidate. The paradox of fulminant myocarditis is that despite severe acute presentation, outcomes are often better than chronic myocarditis if patients survive the acute phase with mechanical support. Rapid recognition of cardiogenic shock, escalation of pharmacologic support as a bridge, and urgent consultation for ECMO are life-saving interventions. The case emphasizes the importance of early involvement of specialized teams (heart failure, ECMO, possibly transplant) and clear communication with families about the severity of illness and treatment plan. VA-ECMO provides complete hemodynamic support while allowing the inflamed myocardium to rest and recover. The addition of vasopressin represents an attempt to support blood pressure through an alternative mechanism while minimizing catecholamine doses that increase myocardial oxygen consumption. This case integrates shock physiology, advanced hemodynamic monitoring, mechanical circulatory support decision-making, and multi-organ support—representing the highest level of critical care medicine.

### Case 6: Early Post-Operative Pancreatitis with Organ Stress
**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Post-operative pancreatitis management, pain-induced respiratory compromise, fluid balance optimization, early AKI recognition  
**Complexity Level:** Moderate

#### Clinical Presentation
**Patient Demographics:**
* Post-operative patient
* Developed acute pancreatitis in early post-operative period

**Vital Signs:**
* Respiratory rate: Elevated (splinting from abdominal pain)
* Pain score: Severe
* Fluid balance: +3.3 L positive (significant fluid accumulation)

**Physical Examination:**
* General: Acute distress from severe abdominal pain
* Respiratory: Shallow breathing, splinting, decreased breath sounds at bases
* Abdomen: Severe tenderness, guarding, distension possible
* Volume status: Evidence of fluid overload (peripheral edema, elevated JVP possible)

**Laboratory Values:**
* Amylase/lipase: Significantly elevated (>3x upper limit of normal diagnostic for pancreatitis)
* Creatinine: Rising (early acute kidney injury)
* Calcium: Hypocalcemia (characteristic of acute pancreatitis)
* Likely elevated white blood cell count
* Possibly elevated bilirubin/transaminases depending on etiology

**Imaging:**
* CT abdomen likely shows pancreatic inflammation, peripancreatic fluid, possible necrosis

**Key Findings:**
* Severe pain causing respiratory splinting
* Atelectasis from reduced chest wall/diaphragmatic excursion
* Significantly positive fluid balance (+3.3 L)
* Early acute kidney injury
* Hypocalcemia

#### Assessment and Plan
**Problem 1: Severe Pain Driving Respiratory Compromise**  
**Assessment:** Acute pancreatitis causes severe, constant epigastric pain that radiates to the back. This pain is often described as the worst pain patients have experienced. In post-operative setting, pain causes significant splinting—patients avoid deep breaths and movement of the diaphragm because it exacerbates abdominal pain. This results in shallow breathing, reduced tidal volumes, basilar atelectasis, and risk of hypoxemia and pneumonia. Inadequate pain control is a primary driver of respiratory complications in pancreatitis patients.

**Plan:**
* Aggressive multimodal analgesia:
  * Thoracic epidural analgesia (gold standard for pancreatitis pain if no contraindications):
    * Provides superior pain relief compared to systemic opioids
    * Enables deep breathing and effective cough
    * Placed at T6-T10 level for pancreatic pain
    * Contraindications: coagulopathy, hemodynamic instability, patient refusal
  * IV opioids if epidural contraindicated or not available:
    * Hydromorphone or fentanyl (avoid morphine as it may cause sphincter of Oddi spasm)
    * Consider PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) for autonomy
    * Titrate to pain score <4/10 to enable respiratory effort
  * Adjunctive agents:
    * Acetaminophen 1000 mg IV every 6 hours (scheduled)
    * Ketamine infusion (0.1-0.4 mg/kg/hr) as opioid-sparing agent
    * Gabapentin for neuropathic component
* Frequent pain assessment (every 2-4 hours)
* Optimize analgesia before respiratory interventions

**Problem 2: Atelectasis and Respiratory Impairment**  
**Assessment:** Splinting from pain combined with supine positioning and abdominal distension causes reduced functional residual capacity, basilar atelectasis, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Risk of progressive hypoxemia and pneumonia if not aggressively managed.

**Plan:**
* Pulmonary hygiene:
  * Incentive spirometry every 1-2 hours while awake (requires adequate analgesia)
  * Respiratory therapy consultation for:
    * Chest physiotherapy
    * Assisted coughing
    * Deep breathing exercises
* Positioning:
  * Elevate head of bed 30-45 degrees
  * Semi-Fowler's position reduces pressure on diaphragm from distended abdomen
  * Frequent position changes
  * Early mobilization as pain allows (sitting in chair, ambulation)
* Supplemental oxygen as needed:
  * Maintain SpO2 >92%
  * High-flow nasal cannula if increased oxygen requirements
  * Avoid mechanical ventilation if possible (worsens pancreatitis outcomes)
* Monitor for respiratory decline:
  * Serial chest X-rays
  * Continuous pulse oximetry
  * Respiratory rate trending
  * Arterial blood gas if concern for hypoxemia or hypercarbia

**Problem 3: Significant Positive Fluid Balance (+3.3 L)**  
**Assessment:** Early aggressive fluid resuscitation is standard in acute pancreatitis management (often 250-500 mL/hr for first 12-24 hours) to maintain intravascular volume and pancreatic perfusion. However, this patient has accumulated +3.3 L positive balance, which is substantial and may contribute to pulmonary edema, abdominal compartment syndrome, and worsening respiratory function. The goal is adequate resuscitation to prevent pancreatic necrosis while avoiding harmful fluid overload. Current evidence suggests goal-directed, moderate fluid resuscitation (not aggressive) improves outcomes.

**Plan:**
* Reassess fluid requirements:
  * Stop routine maintenance fluids
  * Transition to goal-directed fluid therapy based on:
    * Clinical perfusion markers (mentation, urine output, lactate)
    * Hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure, heart rate)
    * Fluid responsiveness testing (passive leg raise, stroke volume variation)
  * Typical goal: 5-10 mL/kg/hr initially, then adjust based on response
* Avoid further unnecessary fluids:
  * No empiric boluses unless evidence of hypovolemia
  * Use crystalloids (lactated Ringer's preferred over normal saline in pancreatitis)
  * Consider albumin if significant third-spacing and hypoalbuminemia
* Monitor for fluid overload complications:
  * Pulmonary edema (chest X-ray, oxygen requirements, physical exam)
  * Peripheral edema
  * Intra-abdominal hypertension/abdominal compartment syndrome (bladder pressure monitoring if severe)
* Consider diuresis if appropriate:
  * If evidence of volume overload AND adequate perfusion
  * Furosemide 20-40 mg IV to mobilize excess fluid
  * Goal: net even to negative 500-1000 mL daily once resuscitation complete
  * Balance diuresis against maintaining adequate pancreatic perfusion

**Problem 4: Early Acute Kidney Injury**  
**Assessment:** Rising creatinine in setting of pancreatitis is common and multifactorial. Causes include hypovolemia from third-spacing (despite total body fluid overload, intravascular volume may be depleted), abdominal compartment syndrome increasing renal venous pressure, and direct inflammatory injury. AKI in pancreatitis is associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality.

**Plan:**
* Optimize renal perfusion:
  * Maintain adequate intravascular volume (goal-directed fluid therapy as above)
  * Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg (vasopressors if needed, though unusual in uncomplicated pancreatitis)
  * Avoid nephrotoxic medications (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, contrast if possible)
* Monitor renal function:
  * Daily creatinine and electrolytes
  * Strict intake and output monitoring
  * Hourly urine output measurement (Foley catheter)
  * Goal urine output >0.5 mL/kg/hr
* Assess for abdominal compartment syndrome if oliguric:
  * Measure bladder pressure (>20 mmHg concerning, >25 mmHg diagnostic of abdominal compartment syndrome)
  * If elevated, may need surgical decompression
* Adjust medications for renal function
* Consider early nephrology consultation if AKI worsens despite optimization

**Problem 5: Hypocalcemia**  
**Assessment:** Hypocalcemia is common in acute pancreatitis due to precipitation of calcium in areas of fat necrosis (saponification), decreased parathyroid hormone secretion, and hypoalbuminemia (reduces total calcium but ionized calcium may be normal). Severe hypocalcemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias, tetany, seizures, and prolonged QT interval. Must check ionized calcium (more accurate than total calcium).

**Plan:**
* Check ionized calcium level (most accurate assessment)
* Correct symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia:
  * Symptoms: perioral numbness, paresthesias, Chvostek's sign, Trousseau's sign, tetany, seizures
  * Severe: ionized calcium <0.9 mmol/L or total calcium <7.0 mg/dL
  * Treatment: calcium gluconate 1-2 g IV over 10-20 minutes
  * May require continuous calcium infusion if recurrent
  * Correct concurrent hypomagnesemia (impairs parathyroid function and calcium repletion)
* Monitor ECG for prolonged QT interval
* Trend calcium levels daily or more frequently if severe
* Supplement vitamin D if deficient (aids calcium absorption)

**Problem 6: Acute Pancreatitis Management**  
**Assessment:** Post-operative pancreatitis management requires supportive care, pain control, and monitoring for complications. No specific pharmacologic therapy has been proven to alter disease course. Key is preventing complications (necrosis, infection, organ failure) and providing supportive care.

**Plan:**
* Supportive care:
  * NPO (nothing by mouth) until pain and inflammation improve
  * Nasogastric tube only if severe nausea/vomiting or ileus
  * Goal-directed fluid resuscitation as above
  * Pain management as above
* Nutrition:
  * Early enteral nutrition preferred over TPN if tolerated (within 24-48 hours)
  * Start with clear liquids once pain improving and no ileus
  * Advance to low-fat diet as tolerated
  * Consider nasojejunal feeding tube if prolonged NPO status anticipated
* Monitor for complications:
  * Pancreatic necrosis (contrast-enhanced CT at 72-96 hours if clinically worsening)
  * Infected necrosis (fever, rising WBC, positive blood cultures, gas in pancreatic bed on CT)
  * Pseudocyst formation
  * Hemorrhage (pseudoaneurysm)
  * Organ failure (respiratory, renal, cardiovascular)
  * Local complications (splenic vein thrombosis, gastric outlet obstruction)
* Antibiotics:
  * NOT routinely indicated for sterile pancreatitis
  * Only if documented infection (infected necrosis, cholangitis, other source)
  * Prophylactic antibiotics do not improve outcomes
* ERCP if indicated:
  * If biliary pancreatitis with cholangitis or persistent biliary obstruction
  * Not routinely needed for gallstone pancreatitis without complications
* Severity assessment:
  * Ranson's criteria, APACHE II, or BISAP score for prognostication
  * Identify severe pancreatitis requiring ICU care
  * Early surgical consultation if necrotizing pancreatitis suspected

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**
This case demonstrates the multi-system impacts of acute pancreatitis in the post-operative setting. The severe pain drives respiratory compromise through splinting, making aggressive pain control essential—epidural analgesia is the gold standard. The positive fluid balance represents a common challenge: pancreatitis requires early aggressive resuscitation to prevent necrosis, but excessive fluids worsen respiratory function and contribute to AKI through abdominal compartment syndrome. The transition from aggressive to goal-directed fluid therapy reflects evolving understanding that moderate resuscitation improves outcomes. The AKI is multifactorial and requires careful assessment of volume status, perfusion, and intra-abdominal pressure. Hypocalcemia is an expected complication requiring monitoring and correction when severe. The case emphasizes supportive care as the mainstay of pancreatitis management while preventing complications through pain control, appropriate fluid management, and pulmonary hygiene.

### Case 7: TBI with Aspiration and Airway Decline
**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Traumatic brain injury management, airway protection thresholds, prevention of secondary brain injury, aspiration pneumonitis management  
**Complexity Level:** High

#### Clinical Presentation
**Patient Demographics:**
* Trauma patient
* Traumatic brain injury

**Neurological Status:**
* Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 10 (moderate TBI)
  * Estimated breakdown: Eye opening 3, Verbal 3-4, Motor 4-5 (scoring declining)
* Mental status: Weakening/declining
* Airway protection: Compromised

**Vital Signs:**
* Respiratory rate: Variable (likely irregular)
* Oxygen saturation: Hypoxemic (aspiration event)
* Heart rate: Bradycardia (concerning for Cushing's triad - increased ICP)
* Blood pressure: Likely hypertensive if Cushing's reflex present

**Physical Examination:**
* Neurologic: GCS 10 and declining, possible posturing, sluggish pupils
* Respiratory: Evidence of aspiration (coarse breath sounds, hypoxemia)
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardia

**Imaging:**
* Head CT: Findings consistent with moderate TBI (contusion, subdural hematoma, diffuse axonal injury, or other pathology)

**Key Findings:**
* Moderate TBI with declining mental status
* Impending airway failure (GCS 10 declining, inadequate airway protection)
* Aspiration event with hypoxemia
* Bradycardia (ominous sign suggesting increased intracranial pressure)
* Risk of secondary brain injury from hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hypotension

#### Assessment and Plan
**Problem 1: Impending Airway Failure in Context of Traumatic Brain Injury**  
**Assessment:** Patient with moderate TBI (GCS 10) demonstrating declining mental status with evidence of inadequate airway protection (aspiration event). GCS ≤8 is traditional threshold for intubation ("8 is the gate"), but intubation should be performed before reaching this point if trajectory indicates deterioration, aspiration occurs, or patient cannot protect airway. Declining GCS suggests evolving intracranial pathology (expanding hematoma, worsening cerebral edema, elevated ICP) or secondary brain injury from hypoxemia/hypercarbia. Delay in securing airway risks further aspiration, hypoxemia-induced secondary brain injury, and difficult intubation in emergent circumstances. Decision for immediate rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is clear.

**Plan:
* Immediate rapid sequence intubation (RSI) for definitive airway protection
* Pre-intubation optimization:
  * Pre-oxygenate with 100% FiO2 (bag-valve mask or non-rebreather)
  * Position patient appropriately (maintain cervical spine precautions if not cleared)
  * Suction oropharynx to clear secretions/aspirated material
  * Ensure IV access and medications drawn up
  * Have difficult airway equipment immediately available (video laryngoscope, bougie, surgical airway kit)
* RSI medication selection for TBI:
  * Induction agent options:
    * Etomidate 0.3 mg/kg IV (hemodynamically neutral, excellent choice in TBI with borderline blood pressure)
    * Propofol 1-2 mg/kg IV (can lower ICP but also lowers blood pressure—use with caution)
    * Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV (previously avoided in TBI but now considered safe; maintains blood pressure)
  * Neuromuscular blocker:
    * Rocuronium 1-1.5 mg/kg IV (preferred in TBI; rapid onset, non-depolarizing)
    * Succinylcholine 1-1.5 mg/kg IV (alternative; very rapid onset but increases ICP transiently)
  * Avoid succinylcholine if possible in TBI to prevent ICP spike
* Hemodynamic goals during intubation:
  * Maintain systolic blood pressure >110 mmHg (prevent hypotension which worsens TBI outcomes)
  * Have vasopressor ready (phenylephrine or norepinephrine push-dose)
  * Avoid hypertension during laryngoscopy (can exacerbate ICP elevation)
* Post-intubation management:
  * Confirm tube placement (end-tidal CO2, chest auscultation, chest X-ray)
  * Secure endotracheal tube carefully (document depth at teeth/gums)
  * Initiate mechanical ventilation with appropriate settings (see below)
  * Sedation and analgesia (see Problem 2)

**Problem 2: Mechanical Ventilation Strategy for Traumatic Brain Injury**  
**Assessment:** Ventilation strategy in TBI must balance lung-protective principles with the need to control PaCO2 to manage intracranial pressure. Hypocapnia causes cerebral vasoconstriction and reduces ICP, but excessive hyperventilation (<30 mmHg) can cause cerebral ischemia. Hypercapnia causes cerebral vasodilation and increases ICP. Target PaCO2 is 35-40 mmHg (normocapnia to mild hypocapnia)—this provides ICP control without risking cerebral ischemia. Hyperventilation (PaCO2 30-35 mmHg) reserved for acute ICP crises as a temporary bridge to definitive treatment.

**Plan:**
* Initial ventilator settings:
  * Mode: Volume control or pressure control
  * Tidal volume: 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight (lung-protective, unless severe ICP crisis requires higher minute ventilation)
* Respiratory rate: 12-16 breaths/min, titrate to target PaCO2
* FiO₂: 100% initially, wean to maintain SpO₂ >92% (target PaO₂ >60 mmHg, ideally >80 mmHg)
* PEEP: 5-8 cmH₂O (balance oxygenation with ICP concerns; high PEEP can increase ICP by impeding venous return)
* Target PaCO₂: 35-40 mmHg
  * Normocapnia optimizes cerebral perfusion while controlling ICP
  * Avoid hypocapnia <30 mmHg (risks cerebral ischemia)
  * Avoid hypercapnia >45 mmHg (increases ICP)
  * Obtain arterial blood gas 30 minutes post-intubation and adjust ventilator
* Hyperventilation (PaCO₂ 30-35 mmHg) only if:
  * Acute ICP crisis with signs of herniation (dilated pupil, posturing)
  * Temporary measure while arranging definitive ICP treatment (surgery, hyperosmolar therapy)
  * Minimize duration (<24 hours) to prevent cerebral ischemia
* Ongoing monitoring:
  * End-tidal CO₂ (EtCO₂) continuous monitoring (approximates PaCO₂, typically 2-5 mmHg lower)
  * Serial arterial blood gases to confirm PaCO₂ targets
  * Adjust respiratory rate to maintain target

### Problem 3: Prevention of Secondary Brain Injury
**Assessment:** Secondary brain injury occurs when the brain is subjected to additional insults after the initial trauma. Major contributors include hypoxemia, hypotension, hypercapnia, hyperthermia, hyperglycemia, seizures, and elevated ICP. Preventing secondary injury is the primary goal of TBI management—the primary injury is irreversible, but secondary injury is preventable and significantly worsens outcomes.

**Plan:**
* Maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP):
  * CPP = MAP - ICP
  * Target CPP 60-70 mmHg
  * Target MAP 80-90 mmHg (assumes normal ICP 10-15 mmHg)
  * Use vasopressors (norepinephrine preferred) to maintain MAP if needed
  * Avoid hypotension (SBP <110 mmHg is harmful in TBI)
* Oxygenation:
  * Maintain SpO₂ >92%, PaO₂ >80 mmHg
  * Avoid hypoxemia (PaO₂ <60 mmHg is harmful)
  * Titrate FiO₂ appropriately
* Ventilation:
  * Maintain PaCO₂ 35-40 mmHg as above
  * Avoid both hypercapnia and severe hypocapnia
* Temperature management:
  * Maintain normothermia (36-37°C)
  * Treat fever aggressively (acetaminophen, cooling devices)
  * Hyperthermia worsens TBI outcomes
* Glucose control:
  * Target glucose 140-180 mg/dL
  * Avoid both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia
* Seizure prophylaxis:
  * Levetiracetam 500-1000 mg IV load, then 500 mg twice daily
  * Alternative: phenytoin or fosphenytoin
  * Prophylaxis typically for 7 days post-injury
  * Treat clinical or subclinical seizures aggressively (consider EEG monitoring)
* Positioning:
  * Elevate head of bed 30 degrees (improves venous drainage, reduces ICP)
  * Maintain neutral head and neck position (avoid jugular venous compression)
* ICP monitoring:
  * Neurosurgery consultation for potential ICP monitor placement (indications: severe TBI, GCS ≤8, abnormal CT, or inability to follow exam)
  * If ICP monitor placed, target ICP <20 mmHg
  * Treat elevated ICP with hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol 0.25-1 g/kg IV or hypertonic saline 23.4% 30 mL bolus)

### Problem 4: Aspiration Pneumonitis/Pneumonia
**Assessment:** Patient has aspirated gastric contents, evidenced by hypoxemia and likely infiltrate on chest X-ray. Aspiration can cause chemical pneumonitis (from gastric acid injury) and/or aspiration pneumonia (if bacterial contamination). Chemical pneumonitis occurs immediately and causes ARDS-like picture. Aspiration pneumonia develops over 24-72 hours. Initial management focuses on supportive care and lung-protective ventilation. Antibiotics are only indicated if aspiration pneumonia develops (fever, rising WBC, new infiltrate, purulent secretions).

**Plan:
* Immediate management:
  * Aggressive oropharyngeal and endotracheal suctioning to remove aspirated material
  * Bronchoscopy if large volume aspiration or particulate matter suspected
  * Position patient to facilitate drainage (if safe neurologically)
* Respiratory support:
  * Mechanical ventilation as above
  * Lung-protective ventilation (low tidal volume 6-8 mL/kg IBW)
  * Adequate PEEP to maintain oxygenation (balance with ICP concerns)
  * FiO₂ titration to maintain SpO₂ >92%
* Monitoring for progression:
  * Serial chest X-rays
  * Arterial blood gases to assess oxygenation and ventilation
  * Monitor for development of ARDS (P:F ratio <300)
* Antibiotics:
  * NOT routinely indicated for witnessed aspiration (chemical pneumonitis)
  * Consider antibiotics if:
    * Aspiration of colonized material (poor dentition, bowel obstruction)
    * Signs of infection develop (fever, purulent secretions, new infiltrate, rising WBC)
  * If antibiotics indicated: ampicillin-sulbactam or piperacillin-tazobactam (cover oral anaerobes and gram-negatives)
* Pulmonary hygiene:
  * Frequent endotracheal suctioning
  * Respiratory therapy involvement
  * Elevate head of bed 30 degrees (also beneficial for ICP)
* Prevention of recurrent aspiration:
  * Endotracheal tube cuff pressure check (maintain 20-30 cmH₂O)
  * Chlorhexidine oral care
  * Consider post-pyloric feeding tube when nutrition initiated (reduces gastric residuals/aspiration risk)

### Problem 5: Bradycardia and Concern for Increased Intracranial Pressure
**Assessment:** Bradycardia in TBI patient is concerning for Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations), which indicates severely elevated ICP and impending herniation. This is a neurosurgical emergency. However, bradycardia can also result from other causes (vagal stimulation during intubation, hypoxemia, medications). Must rapidly assess for signs of herniation and elevated ICP.

**Plan:**
* Assess for herniation syndrome:
  * Pupillary examination (asymmetric, dilated, or non-reactive pupils)
  * Motor examination (new posturing, hemiparesis)
  * Vital signs (hypertension, bradycardia)
  * Review head CT for mass effect, midline shift, effacement of cisterns
* If herniation suspected:
  * STAT neurosurgery consultation
  * Hyperosmolar therapy:
    * Mannitol 0.25-1 g/kg IV bolus (rapid administration)
    * Or hypertonic saline 23.4% 30 mL IV bolus (may be superior to mannitol)
  * Hyperventilation to PaCO₂ 30-35 mmHg temporarily (only until definitive treatment)
  * Elevate head of bed 30 degrees
  * Maintain CPP with vasopressors
  * Prepare for emergency surgery (decompressive craniectomy, hematoma evacuation)
* If bradycardia from other cause:
  * Atropine 0.5-1 mg IV if hemodynamically unstable
  * Assess for hypoxemia (correct with ventilation/oxygenation)
  * Review medications (propofol can cause bradycardia)
* Continuous monitoring:
  * Arterial line for beat-to-beat blood pressure
  * Continuous EKG
  * Frequent neurologic assessments

### Problem 6: Sedation and Analgesia in Ventilated TBI Patient
**Assessment:** Adequate sedation and analgesia are essential for patient comfort, ventilator synchrony, and ICP control (agitation and pain increase ICP). However, sedation impairs neurologic examination, making it difficult to detect neurologic deterioration. Must balance adequate sedation with ability to perform serial neurologic assessments.

**Plan:**
* Sedation strategy:
  * Propofol infusion 20-50 mcg/kg/min (reduces ICP but can lower blood pressure—monitor closely)
  * Alternative: dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/hr (allows neurologic assessment, minimal respiratory depression)
  * Target RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) -2 to 0 (light sedation)
* Analgesia:
  * Fentanyl infusion 25-100 mcg/hr or boluses
  * Adequate analgesia reduces ICP by preventing sympathetic surge from pain
* Daily sedation interruption:
  * Consider brief sedation holds for neurologic examination if ICP stable
  * Assess pupillary response, motor function, GCS
  * Resume sedation after assessment
* Avoid oversedation:
  * Deep sedation obscures neurologic exam
  * May delay recognition of deterioration
* Neuromuscular blockade:
  * Generally avoided in TBI (completely eliminates neurologic exam)
  * Only use if refractory ventilator dyssynchrony or severe ICP elevation requiring paralysis
  * If paralyzed, must have ICP monitor and continuous EEG monitoring

### Problem 7: Neurosurgical Consultation and Ongoing TBI Management
**Assessment:** All moderate-severe TBI patients require neurosurgical evaluation for potential surgical intervention and ICP monitoring. Neurosurgery will determine need for evacuation of hematoma, decompressive craniectomy, or ICP monitor placement.

**Plan:**
* STAT neurosurgery consultation
* Repeat head CT if neurologic decline or 24 hours post-injury
* Consider ICP monitor placement (indications: severe TBI with GCS ≤8, inability to follow exam, need for deep sedation)
* Potential surgical interventions:
  * Evacuation of subdural/epidural hematoma
  * Decompressive craniectomy for refractory ICP elevation
  * External ventricular drain (EVD) for ICP monitoring and CSF drainage
* Disposition:
  * Neuro-ICU if available
  * Frequent neurologic assessments (hourly or more)
  * Continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring
  * Central venous access for medications

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**
This case represents a high-acuity neurocritical emergency requiring immediate airway intervention. The declining GCS in a TBI patient indicates evolving pathology and necessitates immediate RSI before complete airway loss or further aspiration. The aspiration event underscores the urgency—inadequate airway protection has already caused harm. The bradycardia raises concern for Cushing's triad and impending herniation, requiring immediate assessment and possible emergent intervention. The ventilation strategy must balance lung-protective principles with the neurologic imperative to control PaCO₂ (target 35-40 mmHg). Prevention of secondary brain injury through meticulous attention to CPP, oxygenation, temperature, and glucose is the cornerstone of TBI management—the primary injury cannot be reversed, but secondary injury is preventable. The aspiration pneumonitis requires supportive care with consideration of antibiotics only if infection develops. This case integrates airway management, ventilation strategies, ICP physiology, and multi-system critical care in the context of traumatic brain injury.

### Case 8: Septic Shock with Early ARDS
**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Septic shock with respiratory failure, ARDS ventilation strategies, neuromuscular blockade indications, fluid overload management, early CRRT consideration  
**Complexity Level:** High

#### Clinical Presentation
**Patient Demographics:**
* Patient with severe pneumonia progressing to septic shock

**Hemodynamics:**
* Blood pressure: Marginal MAP on norepinephrine
* Requiring vasopressor support with suboptimal response

**Respiratory Status:**
* Mechanically ventilated
* FiO₂: 70% (high oxygen requirement)
* PEEP: 12 cmH₂O (moderate-high PEEP)
* P:F ratio: Likely <300 (consistent with ARDS given FiO₂ and clinical picture)
* Ventilator dyssynchrony: Severe (patient-ventilator asynchrony)

**Fluid Balance:**
* +3.4 L positive (significant fluid accumulation)

**Renal Function:**
* Acute kidney injury present

**Laboratory:**
* Lactate: Likely elevated (septic shock)
* Rising markers of organ dysfunction

**Key Findings:**
* Septic shock with pneumonia as source
* Early ARDS (high FiO₂ requirement, bilateral infiltrates, P:F ratio <300)
* Severe ventilator dyssynchrony
* Significant positive fluid balance
* Acute kidney injury
* Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

#### Assessment and Plan
**Problem 1: Septic Shock with Marginal Hemodynamics on Norepinephrine**  
**Assessment:** Patient with pneumonia-associated septic shock requiring vasopressor support but maintaining only marginal MAP. This indicates inadequate response to single-agent vasopressor therapy. Escalating norepinephrine doses carry risk of excessive alpha-adrenergic stimulation (digital ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, arrhythmias). Adding second vasopressor with different mechanism is appropriate per Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Source control (pneumonia treatment with antibiotics) is ongoing but patient demonstrates worsening multi-organ dysfunction despite treatment.

**Plan:**
* Add vasopressin 0.03-0.04 units/min as second-line vasopressor:
  * Non-adrenergic mechanism (V1 receptor-mediated vasoconstriction)
  * Restores vascular responsiveness to catecholamines
  * Fixed dose (does not titrate)
  * May allow reduction in norepinephrine dose
  * Evidence of mortality benefit when added to norepinephrine
* Continue norepinephrine titration to target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg:
  * May be able to decrease dose once vasopressin added
  * Monitor for adverse effects at high doses (arrhythmias, ischemia)
* Consider stress-dose corticosteroids if refractory shock:
  * Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours or 100 mg IV every 8 hours
  * Consider if requiring high-dose vasopressors (norepinephrine >0.25 mcg/kg/min)
  * ADRENAL trial showed no mortality benefit but faster shock reversal
  * May consider if vasopressin + norepinephrine insufficient
* Serial lactate measurements every 2-4 hours:
  * Lactate clearance >10% indicates adequate resuscitation
  * Rising lactate despite therapy suggests inadequate tissue perfusion or worsening shock
* Ensure adequate source control:
  * Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
  * Review cultures and narrow therapy when sensitivities available
  * Consider bronchoscopy if concern for inadequate drainage/source control

**Problem 2: Early ARDS Requiring High FiO₂ and PEEP**  
**Assessment:** Patient meets Berlin criteria for ARDS: acute onset (pneumonia), bilateral infiltrates, not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload, P:F ratio <300 (likely <200 given FiO₂ 70%). This represents moderate to severe ARDS. Current ventilator settings with FiO₂ 70% and PEEP 12 indicate significant oxygenation impairment. Lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes is essential to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). ARDSNet protocol has demonstrated mortality benefit.

**Plan:**
* Lung-protective ventilation (ARDSNet protocol):
  * Low tidal volume: 6 mL/kg ideal body weight (not actual body weight)
    * Calculate ideal body weight: Males: 50 + 2.3 × (height in inches - 60); Females: 45.5 + 2.3 × (height in inches - 60)
    * Example: 70 kg IBW → tidal volume 420 mL
    * Reduces VILI and improves mortality
  * Plateau pressure <30 cmH₂O:
    * Check with inspiratory pause maneuver
    * Plateau pressure >30 cmH₂O associated with barotrauma
    * If plateau >30, reduce tidal volume further (as low as 4 mL/kg)
  * Driving pressure <15 cmH₂O:
    * Driving pressure = Plateau pressure - PEEP
    * Lower driving pressures associated with better outcomes
  * PEEP titration:
    * Use PEEP/FiO₂ table from ARDSNet
    * Higher PEEP strategy for severe ARDS (PEEP 12-24 cmH₂O)
    * Balance recruitment (higher PEEP) against hemodynamic effects and overdistension
    * Current PEEP 12 is appropriate; may need escalation if oxygenation worsens
  * Permissive hypercapnia:
    * Accept pH >7.20 even if PaCO₂ elevated (may reach 50-70 mmHg)
    * Prioritize lung protection over normocapnia
    * Contraindicated in elevated ICP or severe pulmonary hypertension
* FiO₂ management:
  * Wean FiO₂ as tolerated to maintain SpO₂ 88-95% (avoid hyperoxia)
  * Current FiO₂ 70% is high; attempt to reduce with PEEP optimization
  * P:F ratio <150 may trigger additional interventions (prone positioning)
* Monitor for barotrauma:
  * Daily chest X-rays
  * Assess for pneumothorax if sudden desaturation or hemodynamic collapse

**Problem 3: Severe Ventilator Dyssynchrony**  
**Assessment:** Severe patient-ventilator asynchrony indicates poor coordination between patient's respiratory effort and ventilator delivery. This increases work of breathing, causes patient distress, worsens oxygenation, and can cause self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) where vigorous patient effort generates excessive transpulmonary pressures. Causes include inadequate sedation, inappropriate ventilator settings (flow rate, trigger sensitivity, mode), or underlying respiratory drive abnormalities. In ARDS, dyssynchrony is particularly harmful.

**Plan:**
* Optimize ventilator settings:
  * Mode selection:
    * Consider pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC) or pressure control
    * Allows better flow delivery and pressure limitation
    * Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) if severe dyssynchrony persists
  * Increase inspiratory flow rate if patient "hunger" for air
  * Adjust trigger sensitivity to reduce work of triggering breaths
  * Consider pressure support on top of volume control if allowing spontaneous breaths
* Optimize sedation and analgesia:
  * Ensure adequate analgesia first (fentanyl or hydromorphone)
  * Deepen sedation (propofol or dexmedetomidine infusion)
  * Target RASS -2 to -3 (moderate sedation)
  * May need deeper sedation (RASS -4 to -5) if dyssynchrony persists
* Neuromuscular blockade (NMBA) for refractory dyssynchrony:
  * Indicated in severe ARDS with persistent ventilator dyssynchrony despite optimization
  * ACURASYS trial showed mortality benefit with early NMBA in severe ARDS (P:F <150)
  * More recent ROSE trial showed no benefit with lighter sedation strategies
  * Recommendation: Initiate NMBA for 24-48 hours given:
    * Severe ventilator dyssynchrony
    * Early ARDS with high FiO₂ requirements
    * Risk of self-inflicted lung injury
  * Agent: Cisatracurium 15 mg IV loading dose, then 1-4 mcg/kg/min infusion
  * Monitoring:
    * Train-of-four (TOF) monitoring (target 1-2 twitches)
    * Ensure adequate sedation before and during paralysis
    * Reassess need daily; discontinue once dyssynchrony resolved and oxygenation improved
  * DVT prophylaxis: Ensure pharmacologic prophylaxis while paralyzed
  * Eye care: Lubrication and taping eyes closed
  * Positioning: Turn patient every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers

**Problem 4: Prone Positioning Consideration**  
**Assessment:** Prone positioning improves oxygenation in ARDS by redistributing ventilation to dorsal (posterior) lung regions, improving V/Q matching, and facilitating secretion drainage. PROSEVA trial demonstrated mortality benefit in severe ARDS (P:F <150) with prone positioning for 16+ hours daily. Patient may meet criteria if P:F ratio <150.

**Plan:**
* Assess P:F ratio:
  * Calculate: P:F = PaO₂ / FiO₂
  * Current FiO₂ 70% (0.70): if PaO₂ <105 mmHg, then P:F <150 → severe ARDS
  * Obtain arterial blood gas to calculate precisely
* If P:F <150, initiate prone positioning:
  * Requires multidisciplinary team (6-8 staff members)
  * Ensure adequate sedation ± paralysis before proning
  * Protect eyes, pressure points, lines/tubes
  * Prone for 16-18 hours, then supine for 6-8 hours
  * Repeat daily until oxygenation improves (P:F >150 for 4+ hours in supine position)
  * Monitor for complications (pressure ulcers, facial edema, tube displacement)
* Contraindications to proning:
  * Unstable spinal injury
  * Open abdomen
  * Recent sternotomy or abdominal surgery (relative)
  * Severe hemodynamic instability
  * Pregnancy

**Problem 5: Significant Positive Fluid Balance (+3.4 L) in ARDS**  
**Assessment:** Positive fluid balance of +3.4 L is substantial and likely contributing to worsening ARDS. FACTT trial (Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial) demonstrated that conservative fluid strategy in ARDS improves oxygenation, reduces ventilator days, and decreases ICU length of stay without increasing non-pulmonary organ failures. Excess fluid worsens pulmonary edema, impairs gas exchange, and prolongs mechanical ventilation. However, patient is in septic shock requiring vasopressors, creating tension between maintaining perfusion and avoiding fluid overload.

**Plan:**
* Discontinue routine maintenance fluids:
  * No further crystalloid boluses unless clear evidence of hypovolemia
  * All IV medications converted to concentrated formulations to minimize fluid
* Assess volume status and fluid responsiveness:
  * Clinical exam (JVP, peripheral edema, lung sounds)
  * Bedside ultrasound (IVC assessment, lung ultrasound for B-lines)
  * Passive leg raise test if not clearly volume overloaded
  * Invasive cardiac output monitoring if available (pulse contour analysis, PA catheter)
* If adequate perfusion (MAP ≥65, lactate clearing, urine output adequate):
  * Consider early diuresis:
    * Furosemide 20-40 mg IV bolus or continuous infusion
    * Goal: net negative 500-1000 mL daily
    * Monitor carefully: ensure adequate perfusion maintained
    * May need to increase vasopressors slightly to maintain MAP during diuresis
  * Target conservative fluid strategy (FACTT conservative arm):
    * CVP <4 mmHg (if CVP monitor available)
    * Net even to negative fluid balance
* Balance with shock management:
  * Do not diurese if shock unresolved (rising lactate, worsening perfusion)
  * Maintain adequate preload for cardiac output
  * Optimize vasopressors to allow diuresis
* Monitor response:
  * Improvement in oxygenation (decreasing FiO₂ requirements)
  * Improved compliance (easier to ventilate)
  * Chest X-ray improvement

**Problem 6: Acute Kidney Injury - Consider Early CRRT**  
**Assessment:** Patient has developed AKI in setting of septic shock and significant positive fluid balance. AKI is likely multifactorial: septic ATN (acute tubular necrosis), hypoperfusion from shock, and possible abdominal compartment syndrome from fluid overload. With +3.4 L positive balance and need for diuresis to improve ARDS, but inability to diurese due to AKI, this creates a problematic situation. Early consideration of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be warranted.

**Plan:**
* Assess severity of AKI:
  * KDIGO staging based on creatinine rise and urine output
  * Trend creatinine daily
  * Monitor urine output hourly
  * Check electrolytes (potassium, phosphorus) for complications
* Optimize renal perfusion:
  * Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with vasopressors
  * Ensure adequate cardiac output
* Avoid nephrotoxins:
  * Adjust antibiotic dosing for renal function
  * Hold NSAIDs, avoid contrast if possible
* Consider early CRRT initiation if:
  * Refractory volume overload (+3.4 L and unable to diurese)
    * ARDS worsening due to fluid overload
    * Diuretics ineffective (oliguric renal failure)
  * Severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.2)
  * Hyperkalemia refractory to medical management (K >6.5 mEq/L)
  * Uremia with symptoms (encephalopathy, pericarditis)
  * Electrolyte abnormalities requiring correction
* CRRT vs. intermittent hemodialysis:
  * CRRT preferred in hemodynamically unstable patients (continuous, gentle fluid removal)
  * Better tolerated in shock states
  * Allows precise ultrafiltration for volume management
* Nephrology consultation for CRRT initiation and management
* If CRRT initiated:
  * Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) or hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)
  * Target ultrafiltration rate to remove excess volume
  * Monitor electrolytes closely (rapid shifts)
  * Anticoagulation (regional citrate preferred over systemic heparin)

**Problem 7: Septic Shock Management - Source Control and Antibiotics**  
**Assessment:** Pneumonia is the source of sepsis. Adequate source control requires appropriate antibiotics and supportive care. No surgical intervention typically needed for pneumonia unless empyema requiring drainage develops.

**Plan:**
* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics:
  * Empiric coverage should include hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) pathogens
  * Typical regimen: vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime or meropenem
  * Consider adding azithromycin or fluoroquinolone for atypical coverage
  * Adjust based on culture results and sensitivities
* Monitor for treatment response:
  * Trend lactate (should clear with adequate therapy)
  * White blood cell count
  * Fever curve
  * Vasopressor requirements (should decrease)
  * Procalcitonin (should decrease with effective therapy)
* Source control assessment:
  * Ensure no parapneumonic effusion or empyema requiring drainage
  * Chest X-ray surveillance
  * Consider CT chest if not improving to assess for complications
* Antibiotic stewardship:
  * De-escalate antibiotics based on cultures and clinical response
  * Typical duration: 7-8 days for VAP (may extend if slow response)

**Problem 8: Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)**  
**Assessment:** Patient demonstrates dysfunction of multiple organ systems: cardiovascular (septic shock), respiratory (ARDS), renal (AKI), likely hepatic and hematologic as well. MODS carries high mortality. Management requires comprehensive multi-system support and addressing underlying sepsis.

**Plan:**
* Comprehensive supportive care:
  * Hemodynamic support (vasopressors as above)
  * Respiratory support (lung-protective ventilation, NMBA, prone positioning)
  * Renal support (CRRT if indicated)
  * Nutrition: enteral nutrition via feeding tube once hemodynamically stable
  * DVT prophylaxis: pharmacologic (enoxaparin or heparin) unless contraindicated
  * Stress ulcer prophylaxis: pantoprazole or famotidine
  * Glycemic control: target glucose 140-180 mg/dL
* Daily assessments:
  * SOFA score (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) to track organ dysfunction
  * Mortality prediction and prognostication
  * Goals of care discussions with family given severity
* Monitor for additional complications:
  * ICU-acquired weakness (related to NMBA, steroids, critical illness)
  * Delirium (CAM-ICU scoring when not paralyzed)
  * Healthcare-associated infections (catheter-related bloodstream infections, VAP)
  * GI bleeding (stress ulcer prophylaxis)
  * Pressure ulcers (turn every 2 hours, specialized mattress)

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**
This case represents severe critical illness with multi-organ dysfunction requiring comprehensive ICU management. The septic shock necessitates vasopressin addition to norepinephrine per current guidelines. The ARDS requires strict adherence to lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes, appropriate PEEP, and plateau pressure limitations. The severe ventilator dyssynchrony warrants neuromuscular blockade for 24-48 hours, supported by ACURASYS trial data showing benefit in severe ARDS. If P:F ratio is below 150, prone positioning should be initiated based on PROSEVA trial evidence. The significant positive fluid balance creates a challenging scenario—the patient needs fluid restriction and diuresis to improve ARDS (FACTT trial), but has AKI limiting ability to diurese and is in septic shock requiring perfusion. Early CRRT consideration is appropriate to enable volume removal while maintaining adequate perfusion through vasopressors. The case integrates shock management, advanced mechanical ventilation strategies, fluid management principles, renal replacement therapy, and multi-organ support. It demonstrates the complexity of managing competing priorities in critical illness: maintaining perfusion while avoiding fluid overload, protecting lungs while ensuring adequate ventilation, and supporting all failing organ systems simultaneously.

## Clinical Pearls from Night 1

**Shock Management:**
- Shock index (HR/SBP) >1.0 indicates significant hemodynamic compromise
- Mottling in septic shock is a powerful negative prognostic indicator
- Vasopressin is fixed-dose (0.03-0.04 units/min), does not titrate

**Airway and Ventilation:**
- "8 is the gate" for GCS, but intubate earlier if trajectory declining or aspiration occurs
- In TBI, avoid succinylcholine (increases ICP); use rocuronium for RSI
- PaCO2 35-40 mmHg in TBI; hyperventilation only for acute herniation

**ARDS Management:**
- Calculate IBW, not actual weight, for tidal volume in ARDSNet protocol
- Driving pressure (Pplat - PEEP) <15 cmH2O associated with better outcomes
- NMBA is cisatracurium, not vecuronium or rocuronium, based on trial evidence

**Pain Control:**
- Regional anesthesia is superior to systemic opioids for chest wall/abdominal pain
- Epidural contraindications: coagulopathy, hemodynamic instability, infection at site
- Avoid morphine in pancreatitis (may cause sphincter of Oddi spasm); use hydromorphone

**Fluid Management:**
- Positive fluid balance worsens ARDS—early transition to conservative strategy
- Lactated Ringer's preferred over normal saline in pancreatitis
- Passive leg raise test predicts fluid responsiveness better than static CVP

**TBI Specific:**
- CPP = MAP - ICP; target CPP 60-70 mmHg
- Cushing's triad: hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations (late sign of herniation)
- Hypotension (SBP <110 mmHg) in TBI is independently associated with increased mortality

**Laboratory:**
- Check ionized calcium, not total calcium, in pancreatitis (albumin affects total calcium)
- Lactate clearance >10% within 2 hours indicates adequate resuscitation
- Procalcitonin trends help assess antibiotic response in sepsis

**Communication:**
- DNI status requires early palliative care involvement for symptom management
- ECMO discussions should include realistic outcomes and potential for recovery
- Family meetings should occur within 24 hours of significant clinical changes

### Night 1 Learning Summary
**Key Learning Themes from Tonight's Cases**
1. **Early Identification and Management of Shock States**  
   Across multiple cases tonight, rapid recognition and differentiation of shock types was essential:
   * Post-operative hemodynamic instability (Case 1): Differentiation between hypovolemic (hemorrhage), cardiogenic (pump failure), and obstructive (tamponade) shock using bedside echocardiography
   * Septic shock (Cases 3, 8): Recognition of distributive shock requiring vasopressor escalation, addition of vasopressin as second-line agent
   * Cardiogenic shock (Case 5): Fulminant myocarditis requiring mechanical circulatory support (ECMO candidacy)
   * **Key Principle:** Shock type determines management—fluids for hypovolemic, vasopressors for distributive, inotropes/mechanical support for cardiogenic

2. **Airway Management and Protection Thresholds**  
   Cases 2 and 7 demonstrated critical airway decision-making:
   * TBI (Case 7): GCS 10 with declining mental status and aspiration → immediate RSI indicated
   * DNI patient (Case 2): Comfort-focused care with BiPAP intolerance → HFNC trial and symptom management
   * **Key Principle:** Airway protection threshold is not purely numeric (GCS ≤8) but based on trajectory, aspiration risk, and ability to protect airway

3. **ARDS Recognition and Evidence-Based Ventilation Strategies**  
   Case 8 provided comprehensive review of ARDS management:
   * ARDSNet protocol: Low tidal volume (6 mL/kg IB ), plateau pressure <30 cmH₂O

* NMBA use: Early neuromuscular blockade (24-48 hours) for severe dyssynchrony in ARDS
* Prone positioning: Consider if P:F ratio <150 (PROSEVA trial)
* Conservative fluid strategy: FACTT trial supports net negative fluid balance to improve oxygenation
* **Key Principle:** Lung-protective ventilation is standard of care and reduces mortality in ARDS

4. **Pain Management with Regional Anesthesia Techniques
   Cases 4 and 6 highlighted importance of aggressive pain control:

   * Rib fractures (Case 4): Regional blocks (serratus, paravertebral, epidural) prevent pain-hypoventilation-atelectasis-pneumonia cascade
   * Pancreatitis (Case 6): Epidural analgesia enables respiratory effort despite severe pain
   * **Key Principle:** Multimodal analgesia including regional techniques superior to opioids alone for chest/abdominal pain

5. Fluid Management: Resuscitation vs. Overload
   Multiple cases addressed the delicate balance of fluid therapy:

   * Septic shock (Cases 3, 8): Initial resuscitation necessary, but +3.4 L balance worsens ARDS
   * Pancreatitis (Case 6): Early aggressive fluids standard, but +3.3 L may contribute to respiratory compromise
   * Post-op bleeding (Case 1): Volume resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock
   * **Key Principle:** Assess fluid responsiveness; transition from resuscitation to conservative strategy once stabilized

6. Secondary Brain Injury Prevention in TBI
   Case 7 emphasized prevention of secondary injury:

   * CPP maintenance: Target MAP 80-90 mmHg, maintain CPP 60-70 mmHg
   * Ventilation targets: PaCO₂ 35-40 mmHg (normocapnia), avoid hyper/hypocapnia
   * Avoid hypoxemia: PaO₂ >80 mmHg, SpO₂ >92%
   * Other factors: Normothermia, glucose control, seizure prophylaxis, ICP monitoring
   * **Key Principle:** Primary injury irreversible; secondary injury preventable and significantly impacts outcomes

7. Vasopressor Selection and Escalation
   Vasopressor management featured prominently:

   * First-line: Norepinephrine for septic and most shock states
   * Second-line: Vasopressin 0.03-0.04 units/min added when norepinephrine insufficient
   * Inotropes: Dobutamine for low cardiac output states (myocarditis, septic cardiomyopathy)
   * **Key Principle:** Multi-agent vasopressor therapy with different mechanisms superior to high-dose single agent

8. ECMO Candidacy Assessment
   Case 5 provided framework for mechanical circulatory support:

   * Indications: Refractory cardiogenic shock with end-organ hypoperfusion despite maximal medical therapy
   * Favorable factors: Young age, acute reversible process, no irreversible organ failure
   * Goal: Bridge to recovery (fulminant myocarditis often recovers)
   * **Key Principle:** Early consultation for ECMO prevents irreversible organ damage

9. Goals of Care and Comfort-Focused Medicine
   Case 2 highlighted palliative approach in critical care:

   * DNI status: Align interventions with patient values
   * Symptom management: Low-dose opioids for dyspnea, anxiolytics for distress
   * Communication: Honest prognostication without false hope
   * **Key Principle:** Excellent symptom management is active, skilled care worthy of ICU resources

10. Integration of Multi-System Physiology
    All cases required simultaneous management of multiple organ systems:

    * MODS recognition: Cases 3, 5, 8 demonstrated multi-organ failure
    * Competing priorities: Fluid for perfusion vs. restriction for ARDS; sedation for comfort vs. neuro exam
    * Systems thinking: Understanding how interventions in one system affect others
    * **Key Principle:** Critical care requires holistic approach recognizing interdependence of organ systems

### Progressive Complexity Demonstrated
**Moderate Complexity:**
* Case 2: DNI patient with goals of care decisions
* Case 4: Trauma with regional anesthesia for pain control
* Case 6: Post-operative pancreatitis with organ stress

**Moderate-High Complexity:**
* Case 1: Post-operative shock with diagnostic uncertainty
* Case 3: Refractory septic shock with escalating support

**High Complexity:**
* Case 5: Fulminant myocarditis requiring ECMO
* Case 7: TBI with aspiration requiring immediate airway intervention
* Case 8: Septic shock with ARDS requiring NMBA, potential prone positioning, and CRRT

### Evidence-Based Practice Integration
Tonight's cases incorporated multiple landmark trials and guidelines:

* Surviving Sepsis Campaign: Vasopressor escalation, source control
* ARDSNet protocol: Low tidal volume ventilation
* PROSEVA trial: Prone positioning in severe ARDS
* FACTT trial: Conservative fluid management in ARDS
* ACURASYS trial: Early NMBA in severe ARDS
* Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines: TBI management principles

### Clinical Reasoning Skills Developed
1. Pattern recognition: Identifying shock types, ARDS, herniation syndromes
2. Prioritization: Addressing immediate life threats (airway, breathing, circulation)
3. Differential diagnosis: Considering multiple etiologies and systematically evaluating
4. Evidence application: Integrating guidelines and trial data into management
5. Risk-benefit analysis: Weighing interventions (e.g., NMBA benefits vs. exam limitation)
6. Systems integration: Understanding multi-organ interactions and treatment impacts
7. Communication: Goals of care discussions, family updates, multidisciplinary coordination

### End of Night 1 Cases
