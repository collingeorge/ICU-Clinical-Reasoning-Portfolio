## Case 1: Post-Operative Hemodynamic Instability

**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Post-operative shock differentiation, cardiac output assessment, surgical bleeding vs. pump failure  
**Complexity Level:** Moderate-High

### Clinical Presentation

**Patient Demographics:**
- Post-operative status (specific surgery context to be determined based on clinical scenario)
- Immediate post-operative period

**Vital Signs:**
- Blood pressure: Hypotensive (specific values: low systolic, narrow pulse pressure suggesting low cardiac output)
- Heart rate: Tachycardic (compensatory response to low cardiac output)
- Cardiac output: Low (based on clinical assessment)
- Lactate: Rising (tissue hypoperfusion marker)
- Urine output: Oliguria likely present

**Physical Examination:**
- General: Post-operative, sedated
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, hypotensive, signs of low cardiac output (cool extremities, delayed capillary refill)
- Chest tube: Active output present (quantification needed to assess bleeding)
- Perfusion: Clinical signs of hypoperfusion

**Key Findings:**
- Chest tube output present (raises concern for hemorrhage)
- Rising lactate (tissue hypoperfusion)
- Low cardiac output physiology
- Hemodynamic instability requiring intervention

### Assessment and Plan

**Problem 1: Hemodynamic Instability - Etiology Undifferentiated**

Assessment: Post-operative patient presenting with hypotension, tachycardia, rising lactate, and low cardiac output physiology. Differential diagnosis includes hypovolemic shock secondary to surgical bleeding, cardiogenic shock from pump failure (myocardial stunning, ischemia, tamponade), or distributive shock from systemic inflammatory response. Chest tube output suggests possible ongoing hemorrhage. Critical to rapidly differentiate between hypovolemia requiring volume resuscitation versus cardiogenic etiology where excessive fluids could be detrimental.

Plan:
- Urgent bedside echocardiography to assess:
  - Left ventricular systolic function and ejection fraction
  - Right ventricular function
  - Presence of pericardial effusion or tamponade physiology
  - Inferior vena cava collapsibility for volume status assessment
  - Valvular function
- Initiate norepinephrine to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg for adequate organ perfusion
- Quantify chest tube output hourly
- Trend hemoglobin/hematocrit every 2-4 hours
- Assess fluid responsiveness with passive leg raise or stroke volume variation if available
- Obtain 12-lead ECG to evaluate for ischemia or arrhythmia
- Review intraoperative course and estimated blood loss

**Problem 2: Suspected Tissue Hypoperfusion**

Assessment: Rising lactate in setting of hemodynamic instability indicates inadequate tissue oxygen delivery. May represent inadequate cardiac output, decreased oxygen-carrying capacity from blood loss, or increased oxygen consumption from physiologic stress.

Plan:
- Serial lactate measurements every 2-4 hours to trend response to resuscitation
- Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg to optimize organ perfusion
- Monitor mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) or central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) if central line present
- Assess end-organ perfusion: urine output (goal >0.5 mL/kg/hr), mental status, skin perfusion
- Target lactate clearance >10% within 2 hours as marker of adequate resuscitation

**Problem 3: Post-Operative Bleeding vs. Pump Failure (Cardiogenic Shock)**

Assessment: Must rapidly differentiate hemorrhagic shock from cardiogenic shock as management strategies differ significantly. Chest tube output suggests possible surgical bleeding requiring potential return to OR. However, low cardiac output state could also represent myocardial dysfunction, particularly if cardiac surgery or prolonged procedure with significant fluid shifts.

Plan:
- Quantitative assessment of chest tube output (>100 mL/hr for 2-3 consecutive hours may warrant surgical re-exploration)
- Bedside echo as above to assess cardiac function
- Surgical consultation for evaluation if bleeding suspected
- Coagulation panel: PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, platelet count
- Rule out cardiac tamponade (Beck's triad: hypotension, muffled heart sounds, JVD; equalization of pressures on echo)
- If cardiogenic shock confirmed, consider inotropic support (dobutamine, milrinone) rather than aggressive volume resuscitation
- If hemorrhagic shock, prepare for potential massive transfusion protocol

**Problem 4: Sedation and Analgesia Balance in Hemodynamically Unstable Patient**

Assessment: Adequate analgesia is essential for patient comfort and to prevent sympathetic surge, but sedative and analgesic agents can exacerbate hypotension through vasodilation and myocardial depression. Must carefully titrate to balance comfort with hemodynamic stability.

Plan:
- Optimize analgesia with multimodal approach to minimize opioid requirements
- Consider shorter-acting agents (fentanyl boluses vs. infusion) to allow rapid titration
- If sedation required, use agents with minimal hemodynamic effects (dexmedetomidine if appropriate, though avoid if bradycardic)
- Hold or minimize propofol if hypotensive (significant vasodilatory effects)
- Frequent reassessment of sedation level (RASS score) and hemodynamic response
- Treat pain first, then anxiety, to avoid sympathetic response that increases oxygen demand

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**

This case emphasizes the critical importance of rapidly differentiating shock etiologies in the post-operative setting. The presence of chest tube output raises concern for hemorrhagic shock, but low cardiac output physiology could equally represent cardiogenic shock from myocardial dysfunction or cardiac tamponade. Bedside echocardiography is the key diagnostic tool to guide management. The lactate trend provides objective evidence of tissue perfusion adequacy. Management must be tailored to the specific shock etiology: volume resuscitation for hemorrhage, inotropic support for pump failure, or pericardiocentesis for tamponade. The sedation and analgesia challenge highlights the need to balance patient comfort with hemodynamic stability in critically ill patients.

## Case 2: DNI Patient with Dyspnea on BiPAP

**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Goals of care, comfort-focused management, non-invasive ventilation strategies, end-of-life symptom management  
**Complexity Level:** Moderate

### Clinical Presentation

**Patient Demographics:**
- Elderly patient
- Code status: DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate)
- Underlying conditions: COPD, likely additional comorbidities

**Vital Signs:**
- Respiratory rate: Elevated (severe dyspnea)
- Oxygen saturation: Hypoxemic
- Work of breathing: Significantly increased

**Physical Examination:**
- General: Severe dyspnea, air hunger, anxious appearance
- Respiratory: Increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use, likely decreased breath sounds or crackles depending on pneumonia location
- Mental status: Alert but distressed

**Current Therapy:**
- BiPAP: Poor tolerance, patient unable to maintain therapy
- Antibiotics: Initiated for pneumonia

**Key Findings:**
- Severe dyspnea with air hunger
- BiPAP intolerance (interface discomfort, anxiety, claustrophobia)
- Pneumonia on imaging
- DNI status limiting escalation options
- Anxiety contributing to respiratory distress

### Assessment and Plan

**Problem 1: Severe Dyspnea with Air Hunger**

Assessment: Elderly DNI patient with pneumonia-associated hypoxemic respiratory failure experiencing severe dyspnea and air hunger. BiPAP intolerance limits non-invasive ventilation options, and DNI status precludes intubation. Air hunger represents one of the most distressing symptoms at end-of-life and requires aggressive palliative management. Dyspnea is multifactorial: hypoxemia, increased work of breathing, anxiety, and possibly air trapping from underlying COPD.

Plan:
- Low-dose opioid therapy for dyspnea relief:
  - Morphine 2-5 mg IV/SC every 2-4 hours, titrate to comfort
  - Opioids reduce perception of dyspnea and decrease respiratory drive
  - Monitor for respiratory depression, though comfort takes precedence given DNI status
- Trial of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) as alternative to BiPAP:
  - Better tolerated interface (less claustrophobic)
  - Provides PEEP effect, washes out dead space, delivers heated/humidified oxygen
  - Start at 40-60 L/min, FiO2 titrated to comfort and target SpO2
- Cool air/fan directed at face (can reduce dyspnea sensation)
- Positioning: elevate head of bed, allow patient to find position of comfort
- Minimize exertion and energy expenditure

**Problem 2: Poor Tolerance of Non-Invasive Ventilation**

Assessment: BiPAP intolerance is common in elderly patients and those with anxiety, claustrophobia, or inability to cooperate with therapy. The tight-fitting mask can increase distress and sense of air hunger paradoxically. Alternative strategies needed that align with patient comfort while providing respiratory support within DNI limitations.

Plan:
- Discontinue BiPAP given poor tolerance and patient distress
- Trial HFNC as above (significantly better tolerated)
- If HFNC also not tolerated, simple facemask or nasal cannula at comfort-focused oxygen delivery
- Prioritize patient comfort over oxygen saturation targets
- Document goals of care: emphasis on symptom management rather than physiologic targets
- Avoid repeated attempts to force BiPAP compliance (increases distress)

**Problem 3: Anxiety and Psychological Distress**

Assessment: Severe dyspnea generates profound anxiety, creating vicious cycle where anxiety worsens dyspnea perception. Patient distress from air hunger, awareness of worsening condition, and possible existential concerns about dying. Anxiety management is critical component of dyspnea treatment.

Plan:
- Benzodiazepines for anxiety:
  - Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg IV/PO every 4-6 hours as needed
  - Can be combined with opioids for refractory dyspnea
- Non-pharmacologic interventions:
  - Calm, reassuring presence at bedside
  - Frequent communication with patient and family
  - Chaplain or spiritual care if desired
  - Minimize stimulation, quiet environment
  - Familiar items from home if possible

**Problem 4: Goals of Care Communication**

Assessment: DNI status is established, but degree of other interventions (antibiotics, vasopressors, dialysis) and transition to purely comfort-focused care requires clarification. Family and patient need clear understanding of prognosis and treatment options within DNI framework.

Plan:
- Family meeting within 24 hours to discuss:
  - Current clinical status and trajectory
  - Prognosis with and without treatment escalation
  - Patient's goals, values, and preferences
  - What comfort-focused care means in this context
  - Timeline and expectations
- Palliative care consultation for expert symptom management and goals of care discussion
- Continue antibiotics for now (non-invasive, may provide benefit)
- Provide reassurance without false hope:
  - Acknowledge severity of illness
  - Commit to ensuring comfort
  - Explain interventions focused on quality of life
  - Offer support to family
- Document clear plan aligned with patient wishes
- Consider transition to hospice if appropriate

**Problem 5: Hypoxemia in Context of DNI Status**

Assessment: Hypoxemia contributing to dyspnea, but oxygen saturation targets should be guided by patient comfort rather than arbitrary numerical goals. In DNI patient with severe pneumonia, some degree of hypoxemia is expected and acceptable if patient is comfortable.

Plan:
- Titrate oxygen to patient comfort, not to specific SpO2 target
- HFNC trial may improve oxygenation and comfort simultaneously
- Continue antibiotics for pneumonia treatment
- If patient remains comfortable with SpO2 in 80s-low 90s, this is acceptable
- Frequent reassessment of patient comfort level
- Avoid excessive focus on monitor alarms (can increase family/staff anxiety)

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**

This case highlights the critical importance of aligning medical interventions with patient values and goals of care. The DNI status fundamentally changes the treatment paradigm from life-prolonging to comfort-focused care. BiPAP intolerance in this context is not a "failure" but rather an indication that the intervention is not meeting the patient's needs. The shift to HFNC represents an attempt to provide both physiologic support and patient comfort. Low-dose opioids are evidence-based for dyspnea management and should not be withheld due to concerns about respiratory depression in a DNI patient—comfort is the primary goal. The case emphasizes honest communication with patients and families about prognosis while maintaining hope in the form of excellent symptom management. Palliative care involvement ensures expert guidance in managing distressing symptoms while honoring patient autonomy.

## Case 3: Worsening Septic Shock

**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Refractory distributive shock, vasopressor escalation, source control, early AKI management  
**Complexity Level:** Moderate-High

### Clinical Presentation

**Patient Demographics:**
- Patient with septic shock requiring ICU-level care

**Vital Signs:**
- Blood pressure: Hypotensive despite escalating norepinephrine
- Heart rate: Likely tachycardic
- Lactate: Rising (worsening tissue hypoperfusion)
- Urine output: Oliguria (early acute kidney injury)

**Physical Examination:**
- General: Critically ill appearance
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, hypotensive, possible bounding pulses (high cardiac output distributive shock)
- Skin: Mottling present (severe perfusion deficit, marker of poor prognosis)
- Extremities: Peripheral hypoperfusion

**Laboratory Values:**
- Lactate: Elevated and rising
- Likely elevated white blood cell count or leukopenia
- Creatinine: Rising (acute kidney injury)
- Procalcitonin: Likely elevated

**Key Findings:**
- Septic shock with escalating vasopressor requirements
- Rising lactate despite initial resuscitation
- Mottling (ominous sign)
- Oliguria and early AKI
- Risk of progression to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

### Assessment and Plan

**Problem 1: Refractory Distributive Shock Secondary to Sepsis**

Assessment: Patient meets criteria for septic shock with hypotension requiring vasopressors and elevated lactate. Despite initial resuscitation efforts, patient demonstrates worsening hemodynamics with escalating norepinephrine requirements and rising lactate, indicating refractory shock. Mottling is a particularly concerning finding associated with increased mortality and represents severe microcirculatory dysfunction. The distributive shock physiology results from vasodilation, capillary leak, and myocardial depression. Inadequate response to single-agent vasopressor therapy necessitates escalation and reassessment of source control.

Plan:
- Add vasopressin 0.03-0.04 units/min as second-line vasopressor:
  - Vasopressin works through V1 receptors, different mechanism from norepinephrine (alpha-1 adrenergic)
  - Restores vasopressor responsiveness in catecholamine-refractory shock
  - May allow decrease in norepinephrine dose
  - Vasopressin deficiency is common in septic shock
- Continue titrating norepinephrine to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg
- Consider arterial line placement if not already present for continuous blood pressure monitoring
- Evaluate hemodynamics with bedside point-of-care ultrasound:
  - Assess cardiac function (may have septic cardiomyopathy)
  - Evaluate fluid responsiveness (IVC collapsibility, stroke volume variation)
  - Rule out other shock etiologies (tamponade, massive PE)
- If MAP goals not met with norepinephrine + vasopressin, consider adding epinephrine or phenylephrine
- Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours if refractory shock (consider stress-dose steroids)
- Serial lactate measurements every 2-4 hours to assess response to therapy

**Problem 2: Severe Perfusion Deficit with Mottling**

Assessment: Mottling represents severe microcirculatory dysfunction and is a powerful predictor of mortality in septic shock. The mottling score correlates with severity of illness and risk of death. Rising lactate confirms inadequate tissue oxygen delivery despite macrocirculatory resuscitation (maintaining MAP). This suggests microcirculatory failure where oxygen is not reaching cellular level despite adequate blood pressure.

Plan:
- Optimize oxygen delivery:
  - Maintain hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL (consider higher target of 9 g/dL given severe shock)
  - Ensure adequate oxygenation (SpO2 ≥ 92%)
  - Optimize cardiac output (see inotrope discussion below)
- Document mottling score (knee, lower thigh, upper thigh, upper arm, shoulder) for prognostication
- Frequent reassessment of peripheral perfusion (capillary refill, skin temperature)
- Lactate clearance as resuscitation endpoint
- Consider invasive cardiac output monitoring if available (PICCO, PA catheter) to optimize hemodynamics
- Early discussions with family regarding prognosis given severity of illness

**Problem 3: Fluid Responsiveness vs. Fluid Overload**

Assessment: Patient with septic shock has likely received significant fluid resuscitation during initial management. However, with rising lactate and worsening perfusion, must determine if additional fluids would improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion or contribute to pulmonary edema and organ dysfunction. Many septic shock patients are fluid unresponsive after initial resuscitation, and excessive fluids worsen outcomes.

Plan:
- Bedside ultrasound assessment of fluid responsiveness:
  - IVC diameter and collapsibility with respiration
  - Passive leg raise (PLR) test with stroke volume measurement
  - Pulse pressure variation or stroke volume variation if mechanically ventilated
- If fluid responsive (stroke volume increases >10-15% with PLR):
  - Administer 500 mL crystalloid bolus
  - Reassess clinical response
- If not fluid responsive:
  - Avoid additional fluids (will worsen edema without improving perfusion)
  - Focus on vasopressor optimization
  - Consider inotropic support if cardiac output is low

**Problem 4: Possible Low Cardiac Output Component - Consider Inotrope**

Assessment: While septic shock is typically characterized by high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance, septic cardiomyopathy is common and can result in decreased cardiac output. If cardiac output is inadequate despite adequate preload and afterload (MAP), inotropic support may improve tissue perfusion.

Plan:
- Bedside echocardiography to assess:
  - Left ventricular systolic function
  - Right ventricular function (often impaired in sepsis)
  - Valvular function
- If cardiac output low or ventricular function depressed:
  - Consider dobutamine 2.5-5 mcg/kg/min, titrate to effect (max 20 mcg/kg/min)
  - Monitor for tachycardia and arrhythmias
  - May improve oxygen delivery by increasing cardiac output
  - Can be synergistic with vasopressors
- Alternative: milrinone if dobutamine not tolerated, though more complex in hypotensive patient

**Problem 5: Source Control Evaluation**

Assessment: Adequate source control is fundamental to septic shock management and outcomes. Without source control, antibiotics and supportive care alone may be insufficient. Common sources requiring intervention include abscesses (requiring drainage), infected lines/devices (requiring removal), ischemic bowel (requiring surgery), or obstructed/infected urinary tract (requiring decompression).

Plan:
- Comprehensive source identification:
  - Review imaging for abscesses, collections, or visceral perforation
  - Examine all indwelling devices (central lines, Foley catheter, drains) as potential sources
  - Reassess surgical history for anastomotic leaks or intra-abdominal pathology
- Urgent surgical consultation if source requires operative intervention
- Remove or replace potentially infected devices
- Repeat imaging if source unclear and patient deteriorating
- If intra-abdominal source suspected, consider CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast
- Interventional radiology consultation for percutaneous drainage if abscess identified

**Problem 6: Early Acute Kidney Injury**

Assessment: Oliguria in setting of septic shock represents acute kidney injury, likely multifactorial from hypoperfusion (acute tubular necrosis), inflammatory injury, and possible nephrotoxic medications. AKI in septic shock is associated with increased mortality and may require renal replacement therapy if progressive.

Plan:
- Optimize renal perfusion by maintaining MAP ≥ 65 mmHg (some patients may need higher MAP target)
- Strict intake/output monitoring with hourly urine output measurement
- Avoid nephrotoxic agents when possible (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides unless essential)
- Daily creatinine and electrolyte monitoring
- Adjust medication dosing for renal function
- Consider renal replacement therapy (CRRT) if:
  - Refractory volume overload
  - Severe metabolic acidosis
  - Hyperkalemia refractory to medical management
  - Uremia with clinical manifestations
- Diuretics unlikely to be effective in oliguric AKI with septic shock

**Problem 7: Broad-Spectrum Antibiotic Therapy**

Assessment: Septic shock requires prompt, appropriate antibiotic therapy targeted at likely pathogens. Empiric broad-spectrum coverage should be initiated within one hour of septic shock recognition (Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines). Antibiotics should be narrowed once culture data available.

Plan:
- Continue current broad-spectrum antibiotics (specific regimen depends on suspected source and local antibiogram)
- Typical empiric coverage might include:
  - Vancomycin for gram-positive coverage including MRSA
  - Piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage
  - Consider adding antifungal if risk factors present
- Review culture data daily and narrow antibiotics based on sensitivities
- Source control as above remains critical
- Procalcitonin trending to assess response to therapy and guide duration

**Key Clinical Reasoning:**

This case demonstrates the management of refractory septic shock, where initial resuscitation has been inadequate. The rising lactate and mottling are ominous signs requiring aggressive intervention. The addition of vasopressin as a second-line agent reflects current critical care practice for vasopressor-refractory shock. The case emphasizes the importance of assessing fluid responsiveness rather than empirically administering fluids—many septic patients are harmed by excessive resuscitation. Source control evaluation is paramount; without removing the infection source, even optimal supportive care may fail. The development of AKI represents early organ dysfunction, highlighting the risk of progression to MODS. Inotropic support may be necessary if septic cardiomyopathy is present. This case integrates hemodynamic management, source control, antibiotic therapy, and organ support—the core principles of septic shock management.

## Case 4: Rib Fractures with Respiratory Impairment

**Date of Case Review:** December 6, 2025  
**Primary Learning Focus:** Trauma pain management, regional anesthesia techniques, prevention of pulmonary complications, multimodal analgesia  
**Complexity Level:** Moderate

### Clinical Presentation

**Patient Demographics:**
- Trauma patient
- Mechanism: Motorcycle accident
- Injuries: Multiple rib fractures

**Vital Signs:**
- Respiratory rate: Tachypneic (pain-induced shallow breathing)
- Oxygen saturation: Likely decreased due to hypoventilation and atelectasis
- Pain score: Severe (limiting respiratory mechanics)

**Physical Examination:**
- General: Acute distress from pain
- Respiratory: Shallow breathing pattern, decreased chest wall excursion, splinting
- Chest: Point tenderness over rib fractures, crepitus possible, decreased breath sounds at bases
- Neurologic: Otherwise intact (no spinal cord injury assumed)

**Imaging:**
- Chest X-ray or CT: Multiple rib fractures
- Possible pulmonary contusion
- Atelectasis (volume loss from poor inspiratory effort)

**Key Findings:**
- Severe pain limiting respiratory mechanics
- Shallow breathing with hypoventilation
- Atelectasis developing from inadequate lung expansion
- Risk of pneumonia from poor secretion clearance
- Potential need for surgical intervention requiring pre-operative optimization

### Assessment and Plan

**Problem 1: Pain-Induced Hypoventilation**

Assessment: Multiple rib fractures result in severe chest wall pain that causes splinting and shallow breathing. Patients avoid deep inspiration due to pain, leading to reduced tidal volumes, atelectasis, hypoxemia, and CO2 retention. This pain-ventilation-atelectasis cycle is the primary driver of respiratory complications in rib fracture patients. Inadequate pain control is associated with increased risk of pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and prolonged hospital stay. Aggressive multimodal analgesia is essential to break this cycle.

Plan:
- **Regional anesthesia techniques** (gold standard for rib fracture pain):
  - Serratus anterior plane block (targets lateral rib fractures, ribs 2-9)
  - Paravertebral nerve blocks (targets specific dermatomes, can be placed at multiple levels)
  - Thoracic epidural analgesia (most effective for multiple rib fractures, provides dense bilateral analgesia)
    - Consider epidural placement if ≥3 rib fractures or if oral/IV analgesia inadequate
    - Provides superior analgesia compared to systemic opioids
    - Enables effective coughing and deep breathing
    - Contraindications: coagulopathy, hemodynamic instability, spinal injury
- **Multimodal systemic analgesia** to minimize opioid requirements:
  - Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO/IV every 6 hours (scheduled, not PRN)
  - NSAIDs: ketorolac 15-30 mg IV every 6 hours (if not contraindicated by renal function or bleeding risk)
  - Gabapentin 300-600 mg PO three times daily (neuropathic component, opioid-sparing)
  - Lidocaine patch to chest wall if tolerated
- **Opioid analgesia** as needed despite multimodal approach:
  - IV opioids (morphine, hydromorphone, or fentanyl) titrated to pain relief
  - Consider patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for autonomy and consistent analgesia
  - Goal: pain score <4/10 to enable effective respiratory effort
- Frequent pain reassessment every 2-4 hours
- Optimize analgesia before respiratory therapy interventions

**Problem 2: Atelectasis and Risk of Pneumonia**

Assessment: Shallow breathing from pain leads to dependent atelectasis, particularly in lower lobes. Atelectasis reduces functional residual capacity, causes ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and creates ideal environment for pneumonia development. Mucus plugging from inadequate cough effort further contributes. Prevention of pneumonia is critical to avoid respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation.

Plan:
- **Aggressive pulmonary hygiene:**
  - Incentive spirometry every 1-2 hours while awake
    - Goal: 10 deep breaths per session
    - Requires adequate analgesia to perform effectively
  - Respiratory therapy consultation for:
    - Chest physiotherapy
    - Assisted coughing techniques
    - Flutter valve or positive expiratory pressure (PEP) device
    - Nasotracheal suctioning if unable to clear secretions
- **Positioning:**
  - Elevate head of bed 30-45 degrees
  - Frequent position changes (every 2 hours)
  - Encourage mobilization as tolerated (sitting in chair, ambulation if stable)
- **Supplemental oxygen:**
  - High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) if hypoxemic
  - Provides positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) effect to maintain alveolar recruitment
  - Better tolerated than BiPAP in trauma patients
- **Monitor for pneumonia development:**
  - Serial chest X-rays every 24-48 hours
  - Fever curve monitoring
  - Sputum culture if productive cough develops
  - White blood cell count trending
  - Low threshold for antibiotics if pneumonia suspected

**Problem 3: Ventilation Compromise - Risk of Respiratory Failure**

Assessment: If pain control inadequate or pulmonary injury significant (contusion, hemothorax, pneumothorax), patient may progress to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Intubation and positive pressure ventilation in patient with rib fractures carries risk of pneumothorax or worsening of existing pulmonary contusion. Prevention of respiratory failure through optimal pain control and pulmonary hygiene is paramount.

Plan:
- Close monitoring of respiratory status:
  - Continuous pulse oximetry
  - Respiratory rate trending (tachypnea >30 may indicate impending failure)
  - Serial arterial blood gases if concern for hypercarbia or hypoxemia
  - Work of breathing assessment (accessory muscle use, paradoxical breathing)
- Intubation criteria:
  - Hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen (PaO2 <60 mmHg on high-flow oxygen)
  - Hypercarbia with respiratory acidosis (pH <7.25, PaCO2 >50-60 mmHg and rising)
  - Altered mental status from hypoxemia or hypercarbia
  - Inability to protect airway or clear secretions
  - Exhaustion with impending respiratory arrest
- HFNC as bridge therapy:
  - Start at 40-60 L/min, FiO2 titrated to SpO2 >92%
  - Provides PEEP, reduces work of breathing
  - May prevent intubation if instituted early
- If intubation required:
  - Use lung-protective ventilation (tidal volume 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight)
  - Adequate PEEP to prevent atelectasis
  - Careful plateau pressure monitoring (<30 cmH2O) to avoid pneumothorax
  - Early extubation as soon as able (prolonged ventilation increases complications)

**Problem 4: Pre-Operative Optimization (If Surgical Intervention Needed)**

Assessment: Patient may require operative fixation of rib fractures (surgical stabilization of rib fractures, SSRF) if flail chest, severe displacement, or failure of conservative management. Alternatively, may need other surgical interventions for associated injuries. Pre-operative optimization of pulmonary status is critical to minimize post-operative complications and facilitate early extubation.

Plan:
- **Pre-operative goals:**
  - Pain score <4/10 with effective coughing ability
  - SpO2 >92% on minimal supplemental oxygen
  - Clear chest X-ray or stable/improving atelectasis
  - Ability to take deep breaths with incentive spirometry
  - Adequate airway clearance
- **Communication with anesthesiology:**
  - Discuss regional anesthesia plan (epidural placement if not already present)
  - Anesthetic technique to minimize respiratory depression
  - Post-operative pain management strategy
  - Post-operative disposition (likely ICU for close monitoring)
- **Pre-operative preparation:**
  - Continue multimodal analgesia through morning of surgery
  - Ensure epidural or regional blocks functioning optimally
  - Respiratory therapy optimization
  - Optimize volume status (avoid overload which worsens gas exchange)
  - Correct coagulopathy if present
- **Post
