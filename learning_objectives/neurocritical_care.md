# Neurocritical Care Learning Objectives  
**CTICU Attending-Level Competency Framework**  
Version 1.1 — December 2025

---

# Purpose  
To define the advanced neurologic assessment, physiology, monitoring, and management competencies required for independent, attending-level practice in neurocritical care within a cardiothoracic ICU environment.  
This includes integrating cerebrovascular, cardiac, and respiratory physiology to optimize cerebral perfusion while minimizing secondary injury.

# 1. Foundations of Cerebral Physiology

## Objective 1.1 — Explain intracranial pressure (ICP) physiology  
Competency includes mastery of:
- Monro–Kellie doctrine (brain tissue, blood volume, CSF)  
- Compliance curve (plateau where small volume increases cause large ICP rises)  
- Intracranial elastance and pressure–volume compensatory limits  
- Factors that worsen ICP:
  - Hypercapnia  
  - Hypoxia  
  - High intrathoracic pressure (PEEP, poor compliance)  
  - Pain, agitation, fever  
  - Increased cerebral blood volume  

---

## Objective 1.2 — Explain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) regulation  
The learner must be able to:
- Calculate **CPP = MAP – ICP**  
- Describe cerebral autoregulation and its failure in trauma, SAH, and global ischemia  
- Set disease-specific CPP targets:
  - TBI: **CPP 60–70 mmHg**  
  - SAH (vasospasm risk): **MAP augmentation to maintain CPP 65–80**  
  - Malignant infarction: individualized targets  
- Recognize when CPP optimization conflicts with cardiac function (common in CTICU)

**Attending expectation:**  
CPP strategy must incorporate the heart, lungs, and vascular tone — not just the brain.

---

# 2. Assessment & Monitoring

## Objective 2.1 — Perform high-level neurologic examination  
Proficiency requires:
- Accurate and reproducible GCS evaluation  
- Cranial nerve assessment (pupils, gaze, corneal response)  
- Detection of subtle lateralizing signs  
- Recognition of early systemic deterioration (Cushing’s triad)  
- Motor pattern recognition (decorticate, decerebrate posturing)

---

## Objective 2.2 — Integrate multimodal neuromonitoring  
Learner should interpret:
- ICP waveform morphology  
- CPP trends vs autoregulation indices  
- Brain tissue oxygen (PbtO₂)  
- Transcranial Dopplers (TCDs) for vasospasm detection  
- Continuous EEG for ischemia vs sedation effect vs subclinical seizures  

**Key skill:** Distinguish between metabolic encephalopathy, sedation effect, and structural neurologic injury.

---

# 3. Ventilation & Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) Competencies

## Objective 3.1 — Apply CO₂–CBF coupling to ventilator management  
The learner must:
- Maintain **PaCO₂ 35–40 mmHg** under routine conditions  
- Understand that **hypocapnia → vasoconstriction → ↓CBF**  
- Understand that **hypercapnia → vasodilation → ↑ICP**  
- Avoid routine hyperventilation unless:
  - Signs of impending herniation  
  - Acute ICP crisis unresponsive to initial measures  
  - Temporary bridge to definitive therapy  

---

## Objective 3.2 — Integrate ventilator strategy with brain and cardiac physiology  
Complex interactions the learner must manage:
- High PEEP → ↑ intrathoracic pressure → ↓ cerebral venous return → ↑ ICP  
- Low PaCO₂ targets must be weighed against RV performance  
- Oxygenation failure must not be corrected with ventilation strategies that worsen CPP or cardiac output  

**Attending expectation:**  
Ventilator decisions must explicitly consider ICP, CPP, RV function, and MAP.

---

# 4. ICP Crisis Recognition & Management

## Objective 4.1 — Rapid identification of intracranial hypertension  
Diagnostic anchors:
- ICP > 20–22 mmHg (sustained)  
- Declining CPP (< 60)  
- PbtO₂ < 20 mmHg  
- Worsening exam (pupils, motor response)  
- Plateau or Lundberg A waves  

---

## Objective 4.2 — Execute stepwise ICP management algorithm  
Learner must master the following sequence:

### **Tier 1 Measures** (Immediately Initiated)
- Elevate head of bed 30°  
- Optimize sedation and analgesia (propofol, opioids; avoid hypotension)  
- Target PaCO₂ 35–38  
- Normoxia  
- Normothermia  
- Avoid venous obstruction (collars, kinking, high PEEP)

### **Tier 2 Measures** (If ICP persists above threshold)
- Hyperosmolar therapy:
  - **3% saline bolus** (2–3 mL/kg) or infusion  
  - **23.4% hypertonic saline** for acute crises  
  - **Mannitol** 0.25–1 g/kg if hemodynamically appropriate  
- CSF diversion (EVD drainage)  
- Controlled hyperventilation for emergency ICP reduction (temporary)

### **Tier 3 Measures** (Refractory ICP)
- Neuromuscular blockade  
- Higher MAP targets to increase CPP (balance cardiac function)  
- Decompressive hemicraniectomy  
- Barbiturate coma (high risk; attending-level decision)

# 5. Disease-Specific Neurologic Competencies

## Objective 5.1 — Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)

- BTF guidelines (ICP threshold, CPP range, imaging indications)  
- Avoidance of hypotension and hypoxia (primary killers)  
- Limits of hyperosmolar therapy
