# Sedation & Analgesia Learning Objectives  
**CTICU Attending-Level Competency Framework**  
Version 1.1 — December 2025

---

# Purpose  
To define the knowledge, skills, and clinical judgment required to deliver evidence-based, physiology-informed sedation and analgesia in the CTICU.  
This includes managing complex patients with cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, ARDS, neurocritical care pathology, ECMO, and high-risk postoperative states.

# 1. Foundations of ICU Sedation & Analgesia

## Objective 1.1 — Apply analgesia-first sedation principles  
The learner must:
- Prioritize pain control before administering sedatives  
- Recognize uncontrolled pain as a major driver of tachycardia, hypertension, dyssynchrony, and delirium  
- Implement opioid-sparing or multimodal strategies when appropriate  
- Adjust analgesic needs based on surgical context (sternotomy, thoracotomy, CT surgery, ECMO cannulation)

---

## Objective 1.2 — Understand pharmacologic properties of all major ICU agents  
The learner must master:
- **Opioids:** fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine  
  - Onset, duration, context-sensitive half-time  
  - Hemodynamic effects (histamine release, vasodilation)  
- **Sedatives:** propofol, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, benzodiazepines  
- **Adjuncts:** gabapentinoids, acetaminophen, lidocaine infusion  
- **NMB agents:** cisatracurium, rocuronium  

**Attending expectation:**  
Drug selection must reflect patient physiology rather than habit or convenience.

---

# 2. Sedation Depth & Monitoring

## Objective 2.1 — Target appropriate RASS goals  
Learner must set RASS goals tailored to pathology:

| Clinical Setting | Target RASS |
|------------------|-------------|
| Routine ICU | 0 to –1 (light sedation) |
| Post-cardiotomy with hemodynamic instability | –2 to –3 |
| Severe ARDS requiring NMB | –3 to –4 |
| Elevated ICP / ICP crisis | –4 (deep) |
| ECMO (VA/VV) | –2 to –4 depending on hemodynamics & ventilator goals |

**Attending-level competency:**  
Sedation depth must reflect ventilator mechanics, cardiac function, and neurologic objectives simultaneously.

---

## Objective 2.2 — Conduct structured awakening and breathing trials  
Learner must:
- Perform daily sedation interruptions unless contraindicated  
- Assess for neurologic responsiveness and delirium  
- Identify when awakening poses risk (elevated ICP, severe ARDS with dyssynchrony, ECMO cannula displacement risk)

---

# 3. Multimodal Analgesia & Opioid Stewardship

## Objective 3.1 — Use multimodal strategies to minimize opioid exposure  
Competencies include:
- Utilizing acetaminophen, ketamine (low-dose), regional blocks when appropriate  
- Avoiding high opioid doses that worsen ileus, delirium, and ventilation dependence  
- Implementing OFA (opioid-free anesthesia) principles when feasible post-op  
- Adjusting analgesia for sternotomy, thoracotomy, and chest tube pain  

---

## Objective 3.2 — Identify opioid-related complications  
Learner must recognize:
- Chest wall rigidity (fentanyl)  
- Opioid-induced hyperalgesia  
- Respiratory depression  
- Hemodynamic instability (morphine-related vasodilation)  

---

# 4. Sedation in Complex Hemodynamic & Ventilatory States

## Objective 4.1 — Integrate sedation with cardiogenic and distributive shock management  
Sedation has direct hemodynamic consequences:

- Propofol → vasodilation, myocardial depression  
- Dexmedetomidine → bradycardia, reduced sympathetic tone  
- Ketamine → increased sympathetic output; useful in hypotension  
- Benzodiazepines → prolonged sedation, worsened delirium  

Learner must:
- Select agents compatible with shock physiology  
- Avoid exacerbating hypotension with excessive propofol  
- Use ketamine thoughtfully in patients with tachyarrhythmias or CAD  
- Minimize benzodiazepines whenever possible  

---

## Objective 4.2 — Sedation strategies for ARDS (including NMB)  
Competency includes:
- Deep sedation for ventilator synchrony during high PEEP/low Vt strategy  
- Recognizing when dyssynchrony threatens ARDS lung-protective goals  
- Administering NMB (cisatracurium) for 24–48 hours in:
  - Severe ARDS with PF < 120  
  - Proning sessions  
  - Refractory ventilator dysynchrony  

**Attending expectation:**  
Deep sedation is not automatic in ARDS — it is a targeted intervention for lung protection.

---

## Objective 4.3 — Sedation strategies in RV failure  
The learner must:
- Avoid hypercapnia (sedative-induced hypoventilation)  
- Choose agents that minimize hypotension and RV ischemia  
- Maintain adequate oxygenation  
- Use inhaled vasodilators and careful analgesia to reduce RV afterload  
- Avoid deep sedation unless absolutely necessary (deep sedation → loss of preload optimization)

---

# 5. Sedation in Neurocritical Care

## Objective 5.1 — Apply sedation in the context of ICP & CPP goals  
Must integrate:
- Propofol for short-term ICP control  
- Avoidance of hypotension (CPP-dependent)  
- Dexmedetomidine for cooperative sedation when serial neurologic exams are needed  
- Avoid hypercapnia due to respiratory depression from sedatives  
- Use of NMB to eliminate coughing/straining during ICP crises  

---

## Objective 5.2 — Identify sedation–exam conflicts  
Examples:
- Light sedation needed for neuro exam vs hemodynamics that require deep sedation  
- SAH with vasospasm risk (need higher MAP; avoid hypotensive agents)  
- Post-cardiac surgery Takotsubo + SAH (severely limited sedative options)

**Attending-level competency:**  
Sedation is chosen based on the **dominant physiologic priority** (brain, heart, lungs).

---

# 6. Delirium Prevention & Management

## Objective 6.1 — Identify delirium pathophysiology  
Learner must know:
- Neuroinflammatory changes after CPB  
- Dopaminergic and cholinergic imbalance  
- Effects of sleep deprivation, pain, and immobility  
- Impact of sepsis, hypoxia, electrolyte disorders  

---

## Objective 6.2 — Apply PADIS-based strategies  
Includes:
- Early mobility  
- Circadian entrainment  
- Avoiding benzodiazepines  
- Minimizing deep sedation unless essential  
- Using antipsychotics only for severe agitation threatening safety  

---

# 7. Neuromuscular Blockade Competencies

## Objective 7.1 — Proper indications for NMB  
For:
- ARDS with ventilator dyssynchrony  
- ICP crisis requiring elimination of muscle contraction  
- Severe tetany or shivering interfering with targeted temperature management  
- Refractory hypoxemia during proning  

---

## Objective 7.2 — Monitoring and safety  
Learner must:
- Use TOF monitoring  
- Ensure adequate sedation before paralysis  
- Prevent corneal injury  
- Avoid prolonged infusions unless clearly justified  
- Reassess daily for need  

---

# 8. Communication & Reasoning Competencies

## Objective 8.1 — Deliver attending-level sedation plans  
Competency includes:
- Clearly stating the sedation goal and physiologic rationale  
- Integrating sedation into ventilation, hemodynamics, and neurologic goals  
- Anticipating adverse effects and preventing them  
- Updating the plan dynamically as physiology evolves  

Example:  
**“This patient has RV failure with ARDS. My sedation goal is RASS –3 using primarily propofol with low-dose hydromorphone; I will avoid high PEEP, maintain normocapnia, and avoid dexmedetomidine due to bradycardia risk.”**

---

# Summary  
A learner who achieves these objectives demonstrates:
- Mastery of sedation pharmacology  
- Proficiency in analgesia-first strategy  
- Capability to balance sedation with cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic physiology  
- Expertise in ARDS and RV failure sedation  
- Ability to prevent and manage delirium  
- Attending-level reasoning in complex ICU sedation decisions  

These competencies define readiness for independent sedation management in the CTICU.
