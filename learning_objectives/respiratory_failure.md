# Respiratory Failure Learning Objectives  
**CTICU Attending-Level Competency Framework**  
Version 1.1 — December 2025

---

# Purpose
To define the full range of competencies required to evaluate and manage acute respiratory failure in a cardiothoracic ICU environment.  
These objectives reflect **fellowship-level expectations** and incorporate advanced physiologic interpretation, ventilator optimization, and integration of cardiac–pulmonary interactions.

---

# 1. Foundations of Gas Exchange & Respiratory Physiology

## Objective 1.1 — Differentiate hypoxemic vs hypercapnic respiratory failure  
Learner must be able to:
- Identify **A–a gradient** abnormalities and their causes  
- Distinguish shunt vs V/Q mismatch vs diffusion limitation vs hypoventilation  
- Interpret PF ratio and its implications (mild/moderate/severe ARDS)  
- Recognize mixed mechanisms in post-cardiotomy and septic patients  

---

## Objective 1.2 — Explain the determinants of oxygenation  
Competency includes understanding:
- FiO₂  
- PEEP and functional residual capacity  
- Alveolar recruitment vs overdistension  
- Shunt physiology (refractory to FiO₂ increases)  
- Hemoglobin concentration and cardiac output effects  

**Attending expectation:** Oxygenation failure must be classified mechanistically, not described superficially.

---

## Objective 1.3 — Explain the determinants of ventilation & CO₂ clearance  
Learner should understand:
- Minute ventilation = RR × Vt  
- Dead space fraction  
- Effects of sedation, neuromuscular blockade, and ventilator synchrony

---

# 2. Mechanical Ventilation Competencies

## Objective 2.1 — Initiate and adjust lung-protective ventilation  
Learner should be able to:
- Set Vt 4–6 mL/kg IBW  
- Target Pplat ≤ 30 cm H₂O  
- Maintain driving pressure ΔP < 14 cm H₂O  
- Select appropriate initial mode (VCV/PRVC preferred in ARDS)  

**Key skill:** Evaluate compliance trends to distinguish recruitment vs worsening edema.

---

## Objective 2.2 — Tailor PEEP strategy to patient physiology  
Learner should:
- Apply ARDSNet PEEP–FiO₂ tables for moderate–severe ARDS  
- Use lower PEEP in RV failure and obstructive physiology  
- Recognize that PEEP affects preload and RV afterload  
- Judge when high PEEP is harmful (e.g., low recruitability, poor RV tolerance)  

---

## Objective 2.3 — Interpret pressure–volume mechanics  
Skills include:
- Identifying inflection points  
- Recognizing overdistension (rising ΔP & falling compliance)  
- Differentiating chest wall vs lung compliance issues  
- Assessing patient–ventilator dyssynchrony and resolving it  

---

# 3. ARDS Competencies (High-Importance Section)

## Objective 3.1 — Diagnose ARDS accurately  
- Apply Berlin criteria (timing, imaging, origin of edema, oxygenation)  
- Differentiate ARDS from cardiogenic pulmonary edema using:
  - Echo  
  - Biomarkers  
  - Hemodynamics  

---

## Objective 3.2 — Manage ARDS with evidence-based interventions  
Learner should master:
- Lung-protective ventilation (low Vt, ΔP target)  
- High-PEEP strategy when indicated  
- Prone positioning for PF < 150  
- Neuromuscular blockade for 24–48 hours in severe ARDS  
- Conservative fluid strategy unless shock mandates otherwise  

**Attending expectation:**  
Treatment decisions must reflect understanding of the alveolar stress–strain curve.

---

## Objective 3.3 — Evaluate ARDS for escalation to rescue therapy  
Indications for escalation:
- PF < 80 for > 6 hours despite optimization  
- PF < 50 for > 3 hours  
- Severe hypercapnia with pH < 7.15 despite lung-protective settings  
- Right ventricular failure due to high pulmonary pressures  

Rescue options include:
- Inhaled vasodilators (NO or epoprostenol)  
- APRV (institution-specific)  
- ECMO (VA vs VV based on cardiac function)  

---

# 4. Cardiothoracic-Specific Respiratory Competencies

## Objective 4.1 — Manage ventilation in right ventricular failure  
Learner must recognize that RV failure is **afterload-sensitive** and worsened by excessive airway pressures.

Key competencies:
- Minimize PEEP (5–8 cm H₂O unless ARDS physiology dominates)  
- Avoid permissive hypercapnia (↑ PVR)  
- Keep driving pressure as low as possible  
- Maintain adequate oxygenation  
- Consider inhaled pulmonary vasodilators  

---

## Objective 4.2 — Ventilate post-cardiotomy patients safely  
Must be able to:
- Anticipate poor compliance from atelectasis, fluid shifts, and CPB inflammatory response  
- Recognize dynamic LVOT obstruction after mitral repair  
- Avoid excessive PEEP that worsens RV performance  
- Promote early extubation pathways (FAST-track)  

---

## Objective 4.3 — Manage cardiogenic pulmonary edema  
Competency includes:
- Using moderate PEEP to optimize LV afterload  
- Avoiding high PEEP in RV failure  
- Integrating ventilation with diuresis and vasodilator therapy  
- Recognizing when excessive PEEP worsens CO  

---

# 5. Liberation From Mechanical Ventilation

## Objective 5.1 — Identify readiness for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)  
Criteria include:
- FiO₂ ≤ 50%  
- PEEP ≤ 5–8  
- Hemodynamic stability  
- Improved mental status  
- Manageable secretions  

---

## Objective 5.2 — Conduct and interpret an SBT  
Learner must identify:
- Successful SBT parameters (RSBI < 105, stable RR/Vt)  
- Causes of SBT failure:
  - LV failure (common in CTICU)  
  - Respiratory muscle fatigue  
  - Metabolic disturbances  
  - Undiagnosed residual sedation  

---

## Objective 5.3 — Prevent reintubation following extubation  
Skills include:
- Using HFNC or NIV in high-risk patients  
- Identifying predictors of extubation failure  
- Monitoring post-extubation respiratory drive and work of breathing

# 6. Recognition and Management of Causes of Refractory Hypoxemia

## Objective 6.1 — Systematically evaluate deteriorating oxygenation  
Learner must be able to perform a structured assessment:
- Evaluate recruitment vs overdistension  
- Check for mucus plugging, pneumothorax, auto-PEEP  
- Distinguish cardiac vs pulmonary contributors  
- Identify shunt physiology (prone immediately)  

---

## Objective 6.2 — Implement targeted intervention based on cause  
Examples:
- Atelectasis → Recruitment, PEEP optimization  
- Overdistension → Lower Vt/PEEP  
- RV failure → Reduce PEEP, support RV  
- Pulmonary edema → Diuresis, afterload control  
- Pneumothorax → Immediate decompression

# 7. Communication & Clinical Reasoning Skills

## Objective 7.1 — Present respiratory failure cases at attending level  
The learner must:
- Identify the **dominant physiologic problem**  
- Provide a concise PF ratio, compliance trend, and ventilator mechanics summary  
- State the **central conflict**, e.g.:  
  “The conflict is maintaining oxygenation while preventing RV overload.”  
- Provide a prioritized plan with rationale

# Summary

A learner who meets these objectives demonstrates:
- Mastery of ventilator mechanics  
- Understanding of gas exchange physiology  
- Competence in ARDS management  
- Ability to integrate ventilation with hemodynamics  
- Skill in liberation and failure analysis  
- Attending-level clinical reasoning  

These competencies collectively represent the expected knowledge base for independent management of respiratory failure in the CTICU.
