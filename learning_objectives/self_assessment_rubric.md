# Self-Assessment Rubric: CTICU Clinical Reasoning  
**Attending-Level Mastery Progression Framework**  
Version 1.1 — December 2025

---

# Purpose  
To provide a structured, progressive rubric for evaluating development across core CTICU competencies, emphasizing physiologic reasoning, echocardiography integration, ventilator mastery, sedation strategy, and the ability to resolve multi-organ conflicts.

Learners should reassess themselves weekly or per-case.

---

# How to Use This Rubric  
Rate yourself from **Level 1 → Level 9** in each competency.  
You progress levels *only* when you consistently demonstrate the behaviors listed in the next tier.

Levels:  
- **1 = Novice**  
- **3 = Developing**  
- **5 = Competent**  
- **7 = Advanced**  
- **9 = Attending-level mastery**

---

# 1. Hemodynamic Reasoning

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Identifies hypotension but cannot classify shock. |
| **3** | Recognizes basic shock types using MAP and basic labs. |
| **5** | Integrates lactate, CVP, echo findings, and VTI to classify shock accurately. |
| **7** | Identifies *mixed* shock states and prioritizes the dominant physiologic lesion (e.g., RV failure vs vasoplegia). |
| **9** | Manages complex CTICU hemodynamics independently; anticipates decompensation and selects pressors/inotropes based on mechanistic reasoning. |

---

# 2. Echocardiography for ICU Decision-Making

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Describes gross LV systolic function. |
| **3** | Identifies LV vs RV failure in simple cases. |
| **5** | Performs and interprets LVOT VTI, TAPSE, RV S’, RVEDA/LVEDA, IVC variation. |
| **7** | Integrates echo into every shock evaluation and adjusts interventions accordingly. |
| **9** | Uses echo to resolve complex conflicts (RV failure + ARDS, SAH + Takotsubo, post-cardiotomy shock), functioning at attending level. |

---

# 3. Mechanical Ventilation & Respiratory Failure

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Names ventilator modes. |
| **3** | Sets basic lung-protective ventilation. |
| **5** | Interprets pressure–volume loops, driving pressure, and compliance trends; manages moderate ARDS. |
| **7** | Manages severe ARDS with prone positioning, NMB, hemodynamic integration, and escalating therapies. |
| **9** | Optimizes ventilation in patients with conflicting physiology (RV failure, SAH, shock); functions independently in ARDS management. |

---

# 4. Neurocritical Care (ICP, CPP, SAH, TBI)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Recognizes altered mental status. |
| **3** | Performs basic neurologic exam and knows ICP/Causes. |
| **5** | Manages ICP using tiered therapy; understands CO₂–CBF coupling; sets disease-specific CPP targets. |
| **7** | Resolves neuro–cardiac conflicts (e.g., SAH requiring high MAP vs cardiogenic shock requiring afterload reduction). |
| **9** | Independently manages complex neurocritical cases in CTICU, including refractory ICP, vasospasm, and mixed physiology. |

---

# 5. Sedation, Analgesia, and NMB Strategy

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Lists sedative drugs. |
| **3** | Uses RASS to titrate sedation. |
| **5** | Applies analgesia-first strategy and tailors sedation to hemodynamics, ventilation, and neurologic needs. |
| **7** | Manages ARDS sedation, neuro sedation, and RV failure sedation; uses NMB appropriately. |
| **9** | Designs sedation strategies based on multiorgan interaction (brain–heart–lung) at attending level. |

---

# 6. Shock Classification & Therapeutics

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Identifies shock only by hypotension. |
| **3** | Distinguishes distributive vs cardiogenic shock using basic parameters. |
| **5** | Uses echo, lactate, VTI, and ScvO₂ to classify shock precisely and select therapy. |
| **7** | Manages mixed shock physiology; titrates pressors and inotropes intelligently. |
| **9** | Anticipates deterioration; escalates to MCS (Impella/IABP/ECMO) appropriately and early. |

---

# 7. Right Ventricular Failure Competency

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Recognizes RV dilation on imaging. |
| **3** | Explains basic RV failure physiology. |
| **5** | Manages RV preload, PEEP, driving pressure, and inotrope selection. |
| **7** | Balances ventilation, oxygenation, and PVR reduction in complex RV failure. |
| **9** | Independently manages severe RV failure, including post-cardiotomy RV dysfunction, PE, ARDS-related RV strain. |

---

# 8. Clinical Communication & Case Presentation

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Provides a disorganized, unstructured patient summary. |
| **3** | Gives a basic one-liner and differential. |
| **5** | Provides a concise physiologic problem representation with a prioritized plan. |
| **7** | Consistently articulates the *central physiologic conflict* and proposes correct interventions. |
| **9** | Delivers attending-level case presentations, anticipates counterarguments, and leads clinical discussion. |

---

# 9. Integration of Multisystem Physiology (The Attending-Level Core)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Treats organ systems independently. |
| **3** | Recognizes that interventions in one system affect others. |
| **5** | Integrates lung–heart–brain interactions when forming plans. |
| **7** | Resolves physiologic conflicts (e.g., ARDS + RV failure, SAH + LV dysfunction) in real time. |
| **9** | Thinks in systems-level physiology, using high-level pattern recognition and predictive reasoning — true attending-level competency. |

# Personal Development Log  
*(Use after each case or weekly review)*

- **This week’s strongest competency:**  
- **Primary area for improvement:**  
- **Specific objectives for next 72 hours:**  
- **Longer-term development goal (1–2 weeks):**

# Summary  
This rubric defines the progression from foundational knowledge to **independent CTICU attending-level reasoning**.  
A learner operating consistently at Levels **7–9** in most domains is functioning at a level appropriate for fellowship completion or junior attending practice.
