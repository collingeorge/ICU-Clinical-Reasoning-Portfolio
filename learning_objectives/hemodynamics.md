# Hemodynamics Learning Objectives  
**CTICU Attending-Level Competency Framework**  
Version 1.1 — December 2025

---

# Purpose  
To define the competencies required to evaluate, interpret, and manage complex hemodynamics in the CTICU, with emphasis on **real-time physiologic reasoning, advanced echocardiography integration, and evidence-based therapeutic decision-making**.

This framework reflects expectations for senior residents, critical care fellows, and junior attendings.

# 1. Foundational Physiology Competencies

## Objective 1.1 — Define and interpret the determinants of cardiac output
The learner should be able to:
- Break down **CO = HR × SV** with explicit analysis of preload, afterload, and contractility  
- Recognize physiologic inflection points on the Frank–Starling curve  
- Distinguish between stroke volume reduction from hypovolemia vs reduced contractility vs obstruction  
- Describe ventricular–arterial coupling and its relevance in cardiogenic shock and MCS support  

---

## Objective 1.2 — Apply DO₂/VO₂ physiology to bedside decision-making
Competency includes:
- Calculating DO₂ and CaO₂  
- Interpreting lactate and ScvO₂ as markers of adequacy of DO₂  
- Recognizing when increasing MAP does **not** improve perfusion due to flow limitation  
- Identifying supply-dependent vs supply-independent oxygen consumption  

**Attending-level expectation:** The learner never interprets MAP in isolation.

---

# 2. Comprehensive Hemodynamic Assessment

## Objective 2.1 — Interpret invasive monitoring data
Ability to interpret:
- CVP/RAP in context of right heart function and venous congestion  
- PCWP and LVEDP correlation and limitations  
- SVR and PVR implications on ventricular workload  
- Pulse contour analysis (e.g., PiCCO, FloTrac) and thermodilution data  

**Key competency:** Determine whether abnormal pressures reflect true preload vs compliance abnormalities vs obstruction.

---

## Objective 2.2 — Integrate echocardiography into shock evaluation
Learner should competently perform and interpret:
- LVOT VTI (primary metric for stroke volume)  
- LV systolic/diastolic assessment (EF, E/e’)  
- RV assessment (TAPSE, RV S’, FAC, RVEDA/LVEDA ratio)  
- Septal morphology (“D-sign” for RV pressure overload)  
- IVC variation and hepatic vein Doppler  
- Pericardial assessment for tamponade physiology  

**Attending-level expectation:**  
Echo is used to **classify shock subtype**, not merely describe function.

---

## Objective 2.3 — Perform dynamic fluid responsiveness testing
Skills include:
- Passive leg raise maneuver interpretation using VTI  
- Pulse pressure variation and SVV usage in appropriate conditions  
- Determining **fluid responsiveness vs fluid tolerance**  
- Recognizing when fluids will increase congestion rather than CO  

---

# 3. Shock Classification & Management Competencies

## Objective 3.1 — Identify and classify all forms of shock
Learner should be able to:
- Precisely differentiate hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock based on:
  - Echo signatures  
  - Hemodynamic profiles  
  - Metabolic markers  
  - Physical exam  
- Recognize **mixed shock physiology**, especially:
  - Septic + cardiogenic  
  - Post-cardiotomy (vasoplegia + low output syndrome)  
  - RV failure + distributive shock  

---

## Objective 3.2 — Formulate targeted shock management strategies  
Competency includes:
- Selecting appropriate pressors:
  - **Norepinephrine**: first-line for distributive  
  - **Vasopressin**: adjunct to restore vascular tone  
  - **Epinephrine**: refractory vasoplegia or profound cardiogenic  
- Selecting inotropes appropriately:
  - **Dobutamine**: LV failure, sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction  
  - **Milrinone**: RV failure, pulmonary hypertension, low SVR states  
- Designing escalation pathways for:
  - Persistent hypotension  
  - Rising lactate despite therapy  
  - Declining ScvO₂  
  - No improvement in VTI  

**Attending-level expectation:**  
Management strategies must be mechanistically correct, not protocol-driven.

---

# 4. Right Ventricular Failure & Pulmonary Vascular Competencies

## Objective 4.1 — Diagnose RV failure using multimodal assessment
Learner should identify:
- RV dilation (RVEDA/LVEDA > 0.6)  
- Decreased TAPSE (< 16 mm)  
- RV free-wall hypokinesis  
- Elevated RAP with normal/low PCWP  
- Septal flattening (pressure vs volume overload patterns)  
- Elevated pulmonary pressures (TR jet gradient > 35–40 mmHg)  

---

## Objective 4.2 — Manage RV failure with appropriate ventilation & hemodynamics  
Skills include:
- Reducing PEEP and driving pressure to lower RV afterload  
- Maintaining oxygenation and avoiding hypercapnia (both ↑ PVR)  
- Using vasopressors that support RV perfusion (norepinephrine preferred)  
- Selecting inotropes (dobutamine vs milrinone) based on SVR and blood pressure  
- Initiating inhaled pulmonary vasodilators when appropriate  
- Optimizing—not maximizing—preload  

**Attending-level expectation:**  
The learner understands **RV failure is a preload-sensitive, afterload-intolerant state**.

---

# 5. Post-Cardiotomy Hemodynamics

## Objective 5.1 — Recognize patterns of post-cardiotomy shock
Includes:
- Vasoplegia (low SVR, normal CO early)  
- LV failure after bypass (myocardial stunning)  
- RV failure due to ischemia, elevated PVR, or volume overload  
- Tamponade physiology (early or delayed)  
- Dynamic LVOT obstruction (particularly after mitral repair)  

---

## Objective 5.2 — Develop a structured escalation plan for post-cardiotomy patients
Learner must be able to:
1. Optimize preload (echo-guided)  
2. Initiate appropriate vasoactive agents  
3. Adjust ventilation to reduce RV strain  
4. Use inhaled vasodilators in RV failure  
5. Consider mechanical support early:
   - IABP  
   - Impella  
   - RVAD  
   - VA-ECMO  

**Attending-level expectation:**  
Therapy is tailored to the **dominant physiologic lesion**, not the MAP.

- α, β₁, β₂, dopaminergic receptor effects  
- Afterload manipulation  
- RV perfusion considerations  
- Effects on myocardial oxygen demand

## Objective 7.2 — Use titration principles consistent with attending-level care
- Titrate one agent at a time when feasible  
- Monitor response using **perfusion markers**, not solely MAP  
- Understand interplay of vasopressin with catecholamines  
- Recognize when escalating pressors reflects wrong diagnosis

# 8. Communication & Clinical Reasoning Skills

## Objective 8.1 — Present hemodynamic cases at attending level
Learner must be able to deliver:

  - Lactate  
  - VTI  
  - Filling pressures  
  - Ventilator interaction  
- A clear, prioritized plan based on physiology

# Summary

Competence in CTICU hemodynamics requires the ability to:
- Diagnose shock using multimodal data  
- Integrate echocardiography into every evaluation  
- Tailor vasoactive therapy to the dominant physiologic abnormality  
- Recognize RV failure early and manage ventilation accordingly  
- Escalate to MCS when indicated  
- Communicate clinical reasoning fluently and with precision  

A learner who meets these objectives practices at the level expected for advanced CTICU training and demonstrates readiness for independent management of complex hemodynamic cases.
