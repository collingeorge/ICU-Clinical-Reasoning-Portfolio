# CTICU Morning Handoff — Night-to-Day Transition Summary

**Date:** December 09, 2025  
**Time:** 0500  
**Prepared by:** Collin — CTICU Night Coverage

---

## Patient 1 — POD0 CABG ×3, Vasoplegia + Hypothermia + Bleeding Risk

**Overnight Course:**
- Rewarmed from 35.8 → 36.4°C (still slightly below goal)
- MAP now 64–68 on NE 0.08 + vaso 0.03
- Lactate improved slightly: 3.4 → 3.0
- Chest tube output decreased from 140 → 110 mL/hr
- TTE: LV moderately depressed (EF ~40–45%), RV normal; no tamponade

**Outstanding Issues for Day Team:**
- Continue rewarming to ≥36.5°C
- Reassess pressor needs as SVR improves
- Chest tube output still borderline; continue hourly monitoring
- Repeat coag panel + fibrinogen in AM
- Reassess for possible extubation late morning if lactate continues downward and pressors can be reduced

**Day Plan Priorities:**
1. Pressor wean as temp normalizes
2. Trend lactate q4h until <2.5
3. Evaluate readiness for SBT/possible extubation

---

## Patient 2 — VA-ECMO for Fulminant Myocarditis, Rising Lactate + LV Distension Risk

**Overnight Course:**
- Lactate plateaued but not improving: 5.3 → 5.1
- SvO₂ improved from 58% → 63% after flow increased to 4.3 L/min
- UOP remained low; CRRT started at 0200
- LDH remains elevated; plasma-free Hgb pending
- TTE: LV severely dilated, AV not opening; distension persists

**Outstanding Issues for Day Team:**
- Persistent LV distension → requires LV unloading escalation
- IABP vs Impella: CT Surgery + Cardiology must evaluate
- Oxygenator performance borderline — perfusion recommends possible changeout late morning if gradient widens
- CRRT running even balance

**Day Plan Priorities:**
1. Evaluate for mechanical LV unloading (IABP/Impella)
2. Trend LDH and PFH — decide on oxygenator replacement
3. Maintain flows ≥4.3 L/min; adjust based on SvO₂ and lactate

---

## Patient 3 — POD2 HM3 LVAD With New RV Failure

**Overnight Course:**
- Dobutamine 2 µg/kg/min started; CVP improved 15 → 12
- PI stable at ~2.0; no suction events
- Net fluid –300 mL overnight
- MAP steady 70–72 on NE 0.03
- Renal function stable (Cr unchanged)

**Outstanding Issues for Day Team:**
- Reassess RV function on AM limited echo
- Determine if dobutamine should be continued or transitioned to milrinone
- Assess extubation readiness after RV reassessment

**Day Plan Priorities:**
1. Reduce RV preload further if CVP remains >10
2. Continue gentle diuresis (–500 mL target for the day)
3. Extubation possible later today if PI improves >2.5

---

## Patient 4 — Severe ARDS, Re-proned Overnight, Hypercapnia Post-Supination

**Overnight Course:**
- Re-proned at 2200; oxygenation improved (PF ~90 → 115)
- pH stabilized at 7.24 with permissive hypercapnia
- Switching to pressure control reduced DP to 16–17 but cannot reach <15 yet
- No hemodynamic instability on NE 0.06

**Outstanding Issues for Day Team:**
- Continue prone session through mid-day
- Re-evaluate for ECMO if pH <7.2 or oxygenation worsens when supinated
- CT Chest may be useful if sudden compliance drop

**Day Plan Priorities:**
1. Maintain strict lung-protective ventilation
2. Consider ECMO rounds at 0900 if DP remains >18
3. Continue paralysis until at least 24h mark

---

## Patient 5 — POD1 Hemiarch Repair, Hypertension + Possible Renal Malperfusion

**Overnight Course:**
- Two 250 mL boluses increased CVP to 6; UOP improved modestly (15–20 → 30 mL/hr)
- SBP now 110–125 on nicardipine 3–4 mg/hr + esmolol
- Back pain resolved after BP control
- Creatinine stable; no red flags

**Outstanding Issues for Day Team:**
- Determine if CTA still needed; if UOP increases to >35–40, may defer
- Carefully titrate antihypertensives to maintain SBP 100–120
- Continue frequent UOP and creatinine trending

**Day Plan Priorities:**
1. Maintain tight BP control
2. Repeat BMP + lactate in AM
3. CTA only if UOP worsens or back pain recurs

---

## Patient 6 — POD0–1 Bilateral Lung Transplant, PGD Grade 2–3, Low Compliance

**Overnight Course:**
- PEEP successfully reduced to 6 with stable oxygenation
- DP improved from 22 → 17
- Net fluid –450 mL overnight with diuretics
- Tacrolimus level pending; hemodynamics stable

**Outstanding Issues for Day Team:**
- Continue net-negative strategy
- AM bronchoscopy + BAL
- Evaluate for ECMO candidacy if gas exchange worsens

**Day Plan Priorities:**
1. Goal net negative –1 to –1.5 L for next 24h
2. Maintain DP <15; reduce VT further if needed
3. Follow tacro level and adjust infusion

---

## Patient 7 — Septic Shock, Open Abdomen, Refractory Shock With Venous Congestion

**Overnight Course:**
- Vasopressin started; MAP improved from 54 → 63
- Lactate improved 6.5 → 5.9 but still high
- CRRT running; net even due to hemodynamic fragility
- Bladder pressure 10–12; no significant ACS signal
- No new abdominal distension or worsening tenderness

**Outstanding Issues for Day Team:**
- Reassess source control: do we need repeat imaging or OR?
- Consider adding epinephrine if MAP dips again
- Evaluate infectious workup & consider antifungal escalation

**Day Plan Priorities:**
1. Morning lactate + SvO₂ to assess trajectory
2. Reassess abdomen clinically at least q4h
3. CTA abdomen/pelvis if lactate rises again or MAP deteriorates

---

## Patient 8 — Aneurysmal SAH (PBD2/POD1) + Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy

**Overnight Course:**
- MAP maintained 70–75 with NE 0.05
- CPP stable 65–70; ICP 14 unchanged
- No neuro exam changes
- Sodium stable at 150 on 3% at 30 mL/hr
- No arrhythmias; lactate normal

**Outstanding Issues for Day Team:**
- Morning TCDs for vasospasm screening
- Anticipate MAP dip with next nimodipine doses — prepare for pressor uptitration
- Determine extubation timing (likely tomorrow rather than today)

**Day Plan Priorities:**
1. Maintain CPP ≥65 at all times
2. Continue neuro checks q1h
3. Avoid diuresis; maintain euvolemia

## Global Themes for Incoming Day Team

### Highest-Risk Patients
- **Patient 2:** LV distension + ECMO membrane dysfunction → may require unloading device + oxygenator change
- **Patient 4:** Near ECMO threshold
- **Patient 7:** Persistent shock; source control and CRRT critical
- **Patient 8:** Vasospasm risk peaking from today onward

### Procedures / Studies Expected This Morning
- **Patient 6:** Bronchoscopy + BAL
- **Patient 8:** TCDs
- **Patient 1:** Repeat TTE if pressor needs escalate
- **Patient 5:** CTA only if UOP worsens
- **Patient 2:** Possibly oxygenator changeout and device consult
- **Patient 3:** Limited echo for RV reassessment

### Device Checks
- **ECMO (P2):** Hourly flows + gradient trending
- **LVAD (P3):** PI and suction watch
- **CRRT (P2 & P7):** Filter pressures + UF settings
- **Ventilation:** P4 and P6 require Pplat/DP trending every 2–4 hours
