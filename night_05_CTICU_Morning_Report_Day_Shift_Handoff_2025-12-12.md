# CTICU Overnight Rounds — Clinical Reasoning & Morning Handoff

**Author:** Collin George  
**Setting:** Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU)  
**Institutional Context:** University of Washington (UW Medicine)  
**Purpose:** Academic clinical reasoning portfolio for medical school review  

---

## Overview

This repository documents a full overnight CTICU clinical reasoning exercise involving five patients, including cardiothoracic postoperative care, mechanical circulatory support, ECMO management, and comfort-focused end-of-life care.

The focus of this work is **physiology-driven decision-making**, ethical restraint, and professional communication aligned with academic medicine standards. All content is educational in nature and reflects supervised learning rather than independent medical practice.

## Patient Census (Overnight)

1. **POD1 CABG ×3** — Early low cardiac output physiology  
2. **POD2 Acute Type A Aortic Dissection Repair** — Strict blood pressure control  
3. **Chronic HeartMate 3 LVAD** — Low-flow alarms, RV failure physiology  
4. **VV-ECMO Day 5 (ARDS)** — Oxygen delivery failure despite intact circuit  
5. **Comfort-Focused / Palliative Care** — End-of-life symptom management

## CTICU Morning Handoff Summary  
**Night → Day Shift**  
**Time:** 07:55  

---

### Patient 1 — POD1 CABG ×3
**Primary Issue:** Early low cardiac output physiology  

- Borderline MAP on norepinephrine with rising lactate  
- Oliguric AKI with venous congestion  
- Mild RV dysfunction  

**Day Priorities**
- Review lactate trend  
- Reassess need for inotropic support  
- Consider advanced hemodynamic assessment  
- Delay diuresis until forward flow improves  

---

### Patient 2 — POD2 Acute Type A Aortic Dissection Repair
**Primary Issue:** Graft protection via strict blood pressure control  

- BP controlled on nicardipine  
- Intermittent agitation managed with analgesia ± dexmedetomidine  
- Hypoxemia from atelectasis  

**Day Priorities**
- Maintain strict systolic BP control  
- Continue delirium mitigation  
- Monitor platelets and bleeding risk  

---

### Patient 3 — Chronic HeartMate 3 LVAD
**Primary Issue:** RV failure with inadequate LV preload  

- Intermittent low-flow alarms  
- Rising LDH concerning for suction-related hemolysis  
- Anemia and AKI  

**Day Priorities**
- Review hemolysis markers  
- Reassess volume status and RV support  
- Consider formal echocardiography  

---

### Patient 4 — VV-ECMO Day 5 (Severe ARDS)
**Primary Issue:** Inadequate systemic oxygen delivery  

- ECMO circuit functioning appropriately  
- Hypoxemia attributed to shunt physiology, anemia, and volume overload  
- AKI with oliguria  

**Day Priorities**
- Review lactate and post-transfusion labs  
- Coordinate with nephrology regarding CRRT  
- Continue lung-protective ventilation  

---

### Patient 5 — Comfort-Focused / Palliative Care
**Primary Issue:** End-of-life symptom management  

- DNR/DNI, comfort measures only  
- Opioid- and anxiolytic-based symptom control  
- Family present and informed  

**Day Priorities**
- Maintain comfort-focused care  
- Support family presence  
- No escalation of therapy

## Educational Emphasis

This portfolio highlights:
- Physiologic prioritization over protocol-driven care  
- Appropriate restraint in escalation  
- Ethical alignment with patient goals  
- Clear, professional communication across care teams
